The night sky was lit again by fireworks, which formed the Chinese characteristics of ""lichun"" and the English word ""spring. ""Friday also marks ""lichun,"" or the beginning of spring, which carries an inspiring message to the world under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic and calls on the world to come together for a shared future. In Chinese traditional culture, ""lichun"" symbolizes hope and vitality.From the display of rising Olympic rings and a colossal ice cube, to the unique ignition of a ""snowflake"" Olympic flame, Beijing is innovating green and high-tech standards for the Winter Games. Numerous innovations and technologies, including 5G to AI to space technologies, also came together in perfect fashion to ensure that China delivered what it promised: a simple, safe and splendid event for all.

1,2022-02-05,Beijing Olympics to give zero-COVID policy due credit,"Beijing 2022 opening ceremony Photo:Li Hao/GTThe Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, which kicked off on February 4, will offer the world a short reprieve in what has already been a difficult winter season. Due to threat of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the ongoing pandemic is entering a new stage after more than two years of intense struggle against the virus. On top of the entrainment sports, the spirit of the Olympic Games offers an opportunity for solidarity in these troubling times. It may also offer the world a key opportunity to observe China's effective COVID-19 containment strategies, seeing how its efficient system can mitigate risk to the point that international spectacles can continue largely as normal. Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated in his keynote speech to the World Economic Forum's latest online summit on January 17 that the pandemic is a global issue. He said that countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which our shared destiny hinges. Small boats may not survive a storm, but a giant ship is strong enough to brave a storm. This perspective should give the world hope that our odds of defeating the virus once for all are higher together since a large ship stands a better chance than many smaller boats. China has also been more than willing to share expertise during the pandemic, sending information about the virus - including the virus' sequenced genome - during the initial phases of the pandemic. In early January, the World Health Organization praised the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee for its preparatory work in ensuring the safety of athletes and essential workers during the upcoming games. The hosting city is stepping up efforts to put the risk of transmission under control during the event and, if everything goes smoothly as expected, the event should be a key learning experience for the world on how to deliver such international events in the future. For too long the world has ignored China's successful management of the pandemic for political reasons, which has effectively driven countries to fight the pandemic without using the best information. The fact is that, as the world's largest country by population, China's containment strategy is impressive - but it is not a miracle. It is the result of a people-first, whole-of-society approach to containing the spread of the virus. Some media outlets in some Western countries have painted China's strategy as draconian or authoritarian, often resorting to outright lies to make China's success appear undesirable while denying the results as they stand. It is the height of politicization when a strategy that has doubtless saved the lives of millions of people can somehow be viewed as morally wrong. Likewise, they have claimed that China's COVID-19 management through zero-COVID policy might be a drag on global economy when China is leading the world's global recovery specifically because of its COVID-19 strategy.In 2021, China recorded its highest GDP growth in nearly a decade at 8.1 percent. It recorded another record-breaking year of FDI and also saw its trade volume surpass $6 trillion for the first time. Had China suffered the same economic shutdowns as most of the world, this would have been unachievable. At the same time, had China suffered severe slowdowns due to soaring cases, it would have hurt the rest of the world in serious ways. This is because China has been a key supplier of medical supplies, such as PPE and vaccines, which many countries rely on.Furthermore, China is a major producer of things like electronics and appliances that the world stay-at-home economy is dependent on. So it is no exaggeration to say the world's ability to adapt to the challenge of COVID-19 is predicated on China's strict containment strategies - not suffering because of it. Economic data from around the world clearly shows that higher COVID-19 cases are closely correlated with lower economic output. Just as the international community rejected the politicization of the Olympics this year, so too should the international community reject the politicization of the pandemic. Countries should look to Beijing this February with an open mind, taking it as a key opportunity to learn about how to effectively contain the virus.

2,2022-02-05,"China-Russia meeting injects strong momentum for bilateral ties, world peace","Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) meets and holds talks with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on February 4, 2022. Photo: XinhuaThe presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games is telling. The meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin on Friday also carried significant weight, as the two leaders not only draw a new blueprint for bilateral relations, but also promote world stability and development in a post-pandemic period against the backdrop of intensifying geopolitical and economic conflicts and fierce competition among major powers. A model of neighborly, major power relationsSince the end of the Cold War, China and Russia, learning from history and based on their national interests, have established good-neighborly relations and a partnership of strategic coordination, which were confirmed legally with the signing of the China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation in 2001, setting a model for neighbors and major powers. The features of this bilateral relationship are maintaining independence and treating each other as equals; good-neighborliness and friendly cooperation; no-alliance, nonconfrontation and not targeting third countries. The bilateral treaty was extended in 2021 and given a new connotation. China-Russia relations, at a high level, are endogenous and stable. With close political ties and well-developed mechanisms for exchanges and cooperation, the two countries share a high level of political mutual trust and are economically interdependent. Trade between China and Russia grew from $5.86 billion in 1992 to $107.76 billion in 2020, and surpassed $140 billion in 2021, with an optimized structure of trade goods. China has been Russia's top trading partner for 12 consecutive years, and Russia has always been among China's major trade partners. A partnership for energy cooperation was also consolidated by joint efforts in the fields of oil and gas, nuclear energy and electricity. Among the 15 documents signed during the meeting of the two leaders on Friday, three are related to energy.The pillar of world stabilityThe international community is currently facing serious security challenges and problems. Strategic weapons such as anti-ballistic missiles (ABM) and intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) developed by major forces are eroding global and regional stability. The US is containing China in the Asia-Pacific region, engaging in military confrontation with Russia in Europe and inciting chaos in the regions surrounding China and Russia. As major powers, China and Russia are responsible for maintaining world peace. Both countries have promoted multipolarity and opposed unipolar hegemony, such as the US withdrawal from the ABM and INF treaties, its deployment of a global ABM system, and its formation of ""sinister gangs"" of Quad and AUKUS. Through diplomatic and military means, China and Russia have actively cooperated on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue and the Afghanistan issue after the hastened US withdrawal. The two countries agree that the strategic partnership of coordination can meet their political needs and they have no intention to form a military alliance.During their meeting in Beijing, the Chinese and Russian leaders reiterated their common position on maintaining world stability and reached a new consensus on jointly safeguarding global strategic stability and regional security. The two countries will safeguard the international system with the UN at the core and maintain international order based on international law.Leading forces of economic globalization, regionalizationIn recent years, the process of globalization and regionalization has been severely challenged. An anti-globalization trend is on the rise and the US has resumed unilateralism and protectionism and set aside WTO rules, which seriously disrupted the globalization process. The US and the West have also been politicizing regional cooperation. The sluggish process of globalization and regionalization, coupled with the ravaging pandemic, has severely hampered global economic recovery.While strengthening bilateral economic and trade cooperation, China and Russia are actively maintaining the mainstream of economic globalization to promote world economic recovery. The two countries should continue to safeguard the multilateral trading system of the WTO, promote the full implementation and timely improvement of existing rules, jointly oppose trade protectionism and promote the establishment of an open world economy.China and Russia will jointly promote economic integration of the Asia-Pacific region and resist the fragmentation and politicization of regional cooperation. China and Russia will develop economic and trade cooperation under the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and promote the integrated development of East Asia, Eurasia and South Asia.The meeting of Chinese and Russian leaders in Beijing will bring China-Russia relations to a higher level and inject a strong China-Russia joint force into the world's stability and development.The author is head of the Russian Foreign Policy Research Department at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251468.shtml,opinion/viewpoint

4,2022-02-05,"From 2008 to 2022, a confident China shows the world a new state of mind","Photo taken on Feb. 4, 2022 shows a cauldron holding the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. (Photo: Xinhua)The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games began with a fascinating, vibrant, and glittering opening ceremony that presented the world a China that is becoming more confident. Fourteen years after having hosted the 2008 Games, the country has marched into a new era.This era is different because China no longer has to strive hard to showcase itself to the world. Back in 2008, when China was just about to prove itself on the world stage, grabbing an Olympic moment made the country and the people more than just overjoyed, because it was a precious opportunity for China to show the world ""who I am."" Indeed, the 2008 Games were a game-changer - many people around the world, especially Westerners, no longer viewed China as poor and pathetic, and it was from then on that China peacefully rose to global leadership both politically and economically.With the opening ceremony of the 2008 Games acting as the innovation foundation for the 2022 Games, China is no longer burdened with the task of explaining to the world ""who I am."" Rather, it is in a position to review the world and tell the world ""what I am doing"" in a relaxed and confident manner. If the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics showed the world a magnificent Chinese civilization, the opening ceremony of the 2022 Games presented Chinese civilization and culture in a delicate and light-hearted way. Compared to the 2008 spectacular, the Friday event was noticeably toned down and shortened to about two hours and 20 minutes. This was partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was intended to balance the themes of ""simpleness"" and ""splendidness."" Although the Winter Olympic Games generally attract less attention than the Summer edition, the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics has already caught as many eyes as one can imagine. From the countdown of the 24 solar terms of the Chinese lunar calendar, parade of countries in accordance to the number of strokes that are counted in the first character of their Chinese names, to the unprecedented flame-lit ceremony, each process entails a Chinese element that speaks for itself. Through the opening ceremony of Beijing 2022, China was also shown as a romantic country. Unlike the French version of romance, China's romance is deeply embedded in its cultural maturity and confidence as well as the profound national pride. Indeed, the opening ceremony featured no professional performers or celebrities, only ordinary people. The focus was not on China the country, but on the Chinese people as a whole. Zhang Tengjun, deputy director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that the event sent a unified and warm signal to the world and showcased what humanity should mean. ""Focusing on the people shows China's open-mindedness and elegance, with which China faces the world with more confidence, more kindness and more warmth. This is a new state of mind. With today's economic volume and global status, China aims to present the world an amicable, affable and respectable image,"" said Zhang. With this image in mind, China and the Chinese people do not care too much about the negative sentiment and attitude of US-led Western countries toward China. It is with this image in mind that China withstands their malicious and groundless accusations against the country and focuses on developing its own strengths. It is also with this image in mind that China sticks to its zero-COVID policy with the aim of protecting the lives of people. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Games was a success despite the so-called diplomatic boycott led by the US, and so will be the rest of the Games. All maneuvers that intend to embarrass China will turn out to be embarrassing for the instigators as China continues to calmly march forward. The Beijing Winter Games take place during a time when geopolitical tensions between China and the US-led West are running high. But the event is set to become a watershed of how the West views China as well as how China and the Chinese people view themselves. Confidence does not need to be spoken out, but flows tranquilly.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251450.shtml,opinion/observer
5,2022-02-05,`History will engrave this stroke`: Global Times editorial,"Beijing 2022 opening ceremony Photo:Li Hao/GT On Friday night, as a ""big snowflake"" symbolizing human unity lifted an environmentally friendly Olympic torch, Beijing, the world's first ""double Olympic city,"" once again welcomed old and new friends from all over the world with open arms within a span of 14 years. The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, the first major global sports event held as scheduled since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, is of symbolic significance to both China and the world. As Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out, ""history will engrave this stroke. ""The water of the Yellow River rushed down, the five Olympic rings broke through the ice, and the snowflakes merged into one... In a romantic story of ice and snow, the opening ceremony once again amazed the world. It refreshes glorious memories of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and inspires the emotional resonance of mankind to ""come together for a shared future."" At the opening ceremony, people saw the poetic scene of ""snowflakes as big as a table,"" and also felt the sentiment of ""building a community with a shared future for mankind."" Amid changes and a pandemic unseen in a century, the Beijing Games demonstrates the unity and resilience of mankind, and also brings joy and hope to the world. ""The Olympic Games are maybe the most complex event on this planet,"" International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach once said. ""There are a lot of pieces in this huge and very difficult jigsaw puzzle."" It can be imagined how difficult it is to organize the Games amid the pandemic. But China has overcome one difficulty after another and fulfilled its solemn promise to the world. By delivering a simple, safe and splendid event, China demonstrated that choosing Beijing as the host city ""really is a safe choice,"" as Bach said. The international community once again witnessed that the Chinese people's words can be counted on and China can be trusted.From 2008 to 2022, China hosted two Olympic Games, both at critical moments when the world faces major challenges. Whether in dealing with the global financial crisis back then or in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic now, China's contribution to the world is obvious to all. As President Xi pointed out, from ""One World, One Dream"" in 2008 to ""Together for a Shared Future"" in 2022, China has taken an active part in the Olympic Movement and consistently championed the Olympic spirit. China is committed to pursuing the Olympic ideal with concrete actions.As the Winter Olympics kicks off, 346 million Chinese people have participated in ice and snow sports. China has achieved its goal of engaging 300 million people in winter sports ahead of schedule. China's innovative exploration and contribution are changing the world's ice and snow sports landscape.This is why Bach made the judgment that the Beijing Games will become a dividing line in the history of world ice and snow sports. For China, promoting national fitness and building a sports powerhouse is accelerating with the convening of the Winter Olympic Games. Meanwhile, China has achieved excellent results in terms of both preparation for the Winter Olympics and local development, creating a new model for the sustainable development of the Olympic Games and the region. Chongli of Hebei Province was still a poor county at the end of 2015, but now it has been lifted out of poverty, with one out of every five local residents making a living out of the ""snow industry."" Shougang, an old industrial site, has transformed into a new Olympic landmark. ""Water Cube"" has turned into ""Ice Cube,"" the venue for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games has become a vivid example of reusing the Olympic wealth.China pledged to hold the Games in a ""green, inclusive, open and clean"" manner, which enriches the Olympic culture and contributes Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to the world.February 4 is not only the opening day of the Winter Olympics, but also marks the Chinese solar term ""lichun"" - beginning of spring, which means the recovery of life on earth and represents rebirth and hope. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading and geopolitical games are also heating up in certain areas. The desire of the international community to overcome difficulties and forge ahead has never been stronger. We expect the gathering under the Olympic rings to become the ""light at the end of the tunnel."" We firmly believe that the Beijing Games is a historical moment to display human unity, resilience and global cooperation. We wish the athletes will achieve good results under the new Olympic motto ""Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together.""",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251421.shtml,opinion/editorial
6,2022-02-05,US House chips law to compete with China won't achieve aims: expert,"An employee showcases a semiconductor integrated circuit at an industry expo. Photo: VCGThe US took its maneuvers a step further on Friday as the House of Representatives narrowly passed a multibillion-dollar bill aimed at increasing US competitiveness with China and strengthening US semiconductor manufacturing, thus setting up a dispute with the Senate. The House bill, which could wait weeks or months before being called final amid Senate talks, is an indication that the US is openly showing its China containment stance amid the latter's growing power especially in the high-tech sector, for which China should prepare fully and discreetly, experts said. Meanwhile, the bill won't be a concern to China which is firmly advancing on track to tech self-sufficiency.The bill started as a bipartisan push to bolster US manufacturing and research, but it has been mired in long-standing partisanship concerning US policy on China. The bill has to pass both chambers before it can be sent to the White House for US President Joe Biden's signature.The 2,900-page legislation authorizes nearly $300 billion for research and development, including $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing and research into the key components used in automobiles and computers. It also has $45 billion over six years to ease supply-chain problems that have exacerbated shortages, Reuters reported. It authorizes $8 billion in US contributions to the Green Climate Fund established by the Paris Agreement to combat climate change and to help developing countries cope.House Republicans, however, criticized the bill on multiple points, including what they called a ""slush fund"" for climate programs. ""The bill is not likely to be enacted in its current form given disputes between the House and the Senate. Even if there is almost a consensus on 'targeting China,' some disputes about specific matters still exist,"" Chen Jing, vice president of the Technology and Strategy Research Institute, told the Global Times on Saturday.The Senate in June passed its own bill - the 2,376-page United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) - by 68-32. The legislation included $52 billion to increase domestic semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion for US technology and research to compete with China.When asked for comment on the USICA a day after the bill's Senate passage, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China firmly rejects the bill, which is ""filled with Cold War zero-sum mentality. """"How the US intends to develop and strengthen its competitiveness is its own business, but we are firmly against the US making an issue out of China and perceiving it as an imaginary enemy. The US is the greatest threat to itself. Getting its own house in order trumps all else,"" Wang remarked.The current anti-China campaign is basically a US self-directed show that will not achieve what it wants; moreover, it might place the interests of US firms in danger given the interwoven cooperation between firms on both sides, Chen noted. ""We have already dropped any illusion about the US since its crackdown on Huawei. Even if there is no such US legislation, we have recognized the reality and started making preparations in case the US makes any other leading Chinese firm its next target,"" he said.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251451.shtml,source/economy

A joint statement on deepening bilateral ties was released, which is set to push China-Ecuador relations to a new phase.The two sides should strengthen strategic communication, take the opportunity of launching negotiations around free trade agreement and deepen practical cooperation, Xi said.Bilateral trade increased last year against the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cooperation around energy, infrastructure and telecommunications has yielded fruitful results.Both sides should continue to promote the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation, and create new growth areas such as health, the digital economy, and the green Silk Road, Xi noted.China is willing to continue providing help for Ecuador in terms of fighting the pandemic, and strengthen bilateral cooperation on vaccines.Meanwhile, he expressed the hope that Ecuador could continue providing a fair and convenient business environment for Chinese firms operating in the Latin American country.For his part, Lasso said China is the most important partner for Ecuador, and the cooperation with China is crucial for Ecuadorian social and economic development, while expressing appreciation for China's support in his country's COVID-19 vaccination rollout.Ecuador firmly supports the one-China principle and hopes to strengthen bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, energy, infrastructure and other fields, he said, adding that the country will actively participate in the construction of BRI.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251474.shtml,china/diplomacy

Xi pointed out that in recent years, China-Egypt political mutual trust has been consolidated and practical cooperation has yielded fruitful results. Highlights have also been seen in the two countries' anti-pandemic cooperation. The comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and Egypt sets an example for China's win-win cooperation with Arabian, African and developing countries, Xi said. Xi noted that amid profound changes unseen in a century, China and Egypt shared the common ideology of defending their own interests, pursuing common development and enhancing people's well-being as well as promoting fairness and justice in the world. Xi called on the two countries to continue to support each other on issues of interest and major concerns. The two sides should deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, continue to promote the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and Egypt's Vision 2030, advance cooperation projects such as the development of the Suez Canal Corridor, and carry out cooperation on global development initiatives, he said. Xi called on the two sides to lead the way in China's cooperation with the Arab world and Africa, to build a China-Arab community with a shared future in a new era. He also vowed to continue to support Egypt in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. Egypt has been cooperating with Chinese COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Sinovac in clinical trials since 2020. Sinovac announced Saturday that it is helping Egypt build an automatic refrigeration storage that can store as many as 150 million shots, which will be the biggest in Africa when completed. The Egyptian president thanked President Xi for inviting him to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony, which was excellent and demonstrated China's strength and influence. Al-Sisi said the Belt and Road Initiative has prompted the economic development of Egypt and Egypt is willing to take active part in it. He also said Egypt would like to enhance cooperation with China in various areas, to be China's real friend, and to cope with various challenges together with China. Al-Sisi also invited Xi to visit Egypt as soon as possible after the end of the pandemic. Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251453.shtml,china/diplomacy

China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Tajikistan and strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation with Central Asian nations. Rahmon said that further deepening the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Tajikistan was, is and will be the top diplomatic priority of Tajikistan.The meeting again demonstrated the solidarity between China and Central Asian countries after President Xi chaired a summit on January 25 via video link to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and five Central Asian countries.Experts believed that the concentrated meetings with Central Asian countriesâ representatives at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics reflect Chinaâs determination to place Central Asia in its strategic direction of stability. And it also reflects that the strategic cooperation between Central Asian countries and China has reached a new level.Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Saturday that Chinaâs cooperation with Central Asia is based on full respect for the independence and autonomy of Central Asian countries, and China regards them as equal partners.Zhu also pointed out that under the framework of the unprecedented China-Russia ties, it also provided a model for maintaining stability in international society, especially for promoting cooperation and equality across Central Asia. âBut it was under the premise that it should be in line with the interests of Central Asian countries.â Zhu stressed.In early January, Kazakhstan became a global newsmaker after organized groups of rebels attacked government buildings, police stations, and even the Kazakh National Security Committee's Almaty branch building in broad daylight. At the request of President Tokayev, Russia extended timely assistance to Kazakhstan to quell the turmoil. And China expressed its firm support to Russia and Kazakhstan in cracking down on rioters, which Chinese experts on Central Asia affairs believed was good practice for China and Russia to consolidate the stability of the whole region.âIn fact, the regional cooperation between China and Russia has created a new mode of cooperation in a new era, which respects the will and autonomy of the third party as well as their status. It also guaranteed the coordination among the great powers.â Zhu noted.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251459.shtml,china/diplomacy

(Xinhua) Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic in Beijing on Saturday, and the two leaders highly spoke of the ""iron-clad"" friendship between the two countries, which is considered as a model for international relations. During the meeting, the Chinese leader expressed continued support for Serbia on vaccine production, multilateral cooperation and Belt and Road projects. Xi welcomed Vucic to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games during their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Saturday morning.Xi pointed out that China and Serbia are ""iron-clad friends,"" noting the two countries share a high level of political mutual trust and that the bilateral relationship has endured many challenges and become a model for international ties.In recent years, the relationship between the two countries has achieved leapfrog development and the two sides have implemented a number of important cooperation projects in the fields of infrastructure, energy and production capacity, leading Central and Eastern European countries. After the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, China and Serbia have helped and supported each other, continuing to write new chapters for the friendship and leaving beautiful memories in the hearts of the peoples of the two countries.Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, China has provided Serbia with masks, ventilators, medical supplies, and then vaccines to help the Balkan country combat the pandemic. Vucic himself received the injection of China's Sinopharm vaccine in last April. This iron-clad friendship has even grown stronger during the pandemic. Xi stressed that in the face of the changes in this century and the pandemic, the two sides should view China-Serbia relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, insist and develop China-Serbia friendship, and firmly support each other's fundamental and long-term interests. China firmly supports the development path chosen by the Serbian people. The two sides should strengthen strategic alignment, jointly build the Belt and Road initiative through high quality projects and promote cooperation projects to transform the traditional friendship between China and Serbia into more practical results.China will continue to provide support to Serbia in its fight against the pandemic and strengthen cooperation in joint vaccine production and resumption of production, Xi said.China is willing to, together with Serbia, strengthen international cooperation in multilateral fields, jointly safeguard the international order, safeguard the basic norms of international relations and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi noted.Vucic praised the opening ceremony on Friday night, saying that the entire audience enjoyed this visual feast. ""Thanks to the thoughtful and warm reception from the Chinese side. We deeply appreciate the sincerity and friendliness of the Chinese people,"" he said.Vucic noted that since President Xi visited Serbia in 2016, bilateral trade has tripled and the Budapest-Belgrade railway has achieved positive results. Serbia's economic growth rate has been among the best in Europe for years.Serbia is China's true friend. Serbia respects China and admires China's great leadership. No pressure or difficulties will change the steely friendship between Serbia and China, Vucic said.He also noted that Serbia will always stand firmly with the Chinese people on issues concerning China's core interests such as matters involving Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region or the island of Taiwan.Vucic also welcomed President Xi to visit Serbia as soon as possible after the pandemic.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251461.shtml,china/diplomacy
11,2022-02-06,"A truly high-tech Winter Gamesï¼5G, AI, cloud, and more seen at Beijing`s sports gala","A canteen robot serves food at the Olympic Village on January 29, 2022 Photo: VCGFrom unmanned broadcasting, 5G-wired high-speed trains, robot restaurants, zero-gravity beds to coronavirus prevention robots, the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing is not only a global sporting carnival while the pandemic still rages, but the event also turns out to be a concentrated display of latest high and new technologies. These dazzling technologies, some of which haven't been widely applied in our daily life, have received increased exposure through the Beijing Winter Games, creating more possibilities for international tech giants. The one that has drew most attention is the smart bed technology in the athletes' village, which includes a ""zero-G"" mode that can help athletes improve blood circulation and accelerate recovery from a hard training course. Athletes have already taken to social media to praise the beds, contrasting with last year's Summer Games in Tokyo when many athletes publicly complained about the small, cardboard beds they were provided with. ""I have something incredible to share,"" said US athlete Summer Britcher in a TikTok video clip, in which she shows off and details the luxurious remote-controlled beds. In a follow-up video, Britcher was seen happily tucked in and said, ""I'm in Zero-G mode now. It's phenomenal."" Indeed, to offer smart and convenient experiences for athletes and the media, as well as for the anti-pandemic needs, more than 200 types of technology, including 5G, AI, cloud, high-speed rail and new energy, have been tested and used across various aspects of the event, according to a report from domestic news site sciencenet.cn. Photo:VCGTech for healthCoronavirus prevention and control represents one of the top priorities for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, thus advanced technologies aiming to reduce in-person contact and improve COVID-19 test efficiency are becoming one of the top settings for the organizers. For instance, the ""underarm Band-Aid"", a similar size to that of a mobile phone card, helps measure body temperature. The staff can simply apply the smart thermometer to their skin and the temperature data will be displayed in an app on their mobile phones. This allows athletes and spectators to monitor the temperature of each staff member in real-time and it will alert automatically if the body temperature exceeds 37.3 degrees Celsius, according to a report from the People's Daily.The dried blood spot (DBS) testing, a new technique for collecting biological samples, will also be used in the Games for the first time. It collects whole blood samples for storage and subsequent analysis. With the advantage of using only small blood volumes, convenience, reliability, and greater sample stability, DBS testing will be a powerful weapon in the fight against doping in the Games.An advanced remote ultrasonic robot diagnosis system will be used in the closed-loop management area for patients treatment, enabling a ""doctor-patient non-contact"" diagnosis, according to a statement MGI, a Shenzhen-based producer of high throughput genome sequencing machine, sent to the Global Times.The remote ultrasonic robot diagnosis system is divided into a doctor end and a patient end. During the Olympic Games, the patient end was deployed in the closed-loop clinic, and the sonographer could complete remote scanning and real-time consultation and communication outside the closed-loop area through the doctor-end profiling probe, according to the company.The Games' competition venues are equipped with an aerosol coronavirus detection system, which can realize early warning and rapid detection, with detection sensitivity three times higher than traditional methods.Robots are disinfecting sporting venues and providing hand sanitizer. And driverless electric vehicles will make deliveries between the closed-loop area and other areas to reduce person-to-person contact.A peek into futureMore than anti-pandemic use, the technologies that remain in their testing stage or waiting for public use have also shown their value - from training preparation to venue construction, technologies in clean energy - during the rare global event that comes amid pandemic, offering a glimpse of what life and the games would look like in the future.For instance, the opening ceremony held in the National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, has used the world's largest 3.5G bandwidth for the first time, and can achieve the ultimate speed experience of 1.5Gbps downlink and 500Mbps uplink, achieving the world's fastest 5G speed, China Unicom said in a statement it sent to the Global Times on Sunday.The firm also helped build the 5G network on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway, the world's first smart high-speed rail fully covered by 5G.When it comes to services, Beijing Winter Olympic Games have employed virtual humans as a means for broadcasting sign language. The first AI sign language anchor created by Baidu Smart Cloud was launched ahead of the Games' official opening. She has ""real-life"" skin, hair, and eyes, a friendly and natural image, and an elegant and unique temperament. With AI capability, the anchor provides sign language services for hearing-impaired users, allowing them to quickly obtain event information.

12,2022-02-06,Argentina officially joins BRI in major boost for China-Latin America cooperation,"National flags of China and Argentina Photo: VCGArgentina has officially joined the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on the 50th anniversary of China-Argentina diplomatic ties, with top leaders from both countries expressing their willingness to further deepen bilateral cooperation as well as cooperation between China and Latin America. Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Argentine President Alberto Fernandez in Beijing on Sunday after Fernandez attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. Following the meeting, a joint statement on deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership with the signing of a series of documents for future cooperation was released.In a major step, officials from China and Argentina signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation within the framework of the BRI, aiming to promote the construction of the BRI in Argentina and cooperation in various fields, including policy communication, connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, people-to-people exchanges, and third-party markets, the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, said on Sunday. During the meeting, Xi stressed that the two countries should promote the high-quality construction of the BRI and implement existing major cooperation projects such as hydropower plants and railways, while giving full play to their complementary advantages and deepening cooperation in various fields.In addition to the MoU on BRI cooperation, the two countries also signed cooperation documents for over ten areas, including green development, the digital economy, aerospace, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, technological innovation and agriculture. Analysts noted that Argentina will greatly benefit from the BRI in multiple fields such as infrastructure construction, economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and investment, which will have a positive effect on Latin American countries that have yet to join the BRI.Argentina will be able to attract more investment from China and deepen comprehensive cooperation in bilateral trade and investment in some key fields such as energy and the digital economy, Wang Youming, director of the Institute of Developing Countries at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday. According to the joint statement, the two sides agreed to enhance bilateral trade cooperation and continue to expand trade, while promoting financial support for the settlement of China's exports to Argentina and actively encouraging the promotion of trade diversification. A previously signed bilateral local currency swap agreement has played an important role in maintaining Argentina's financial stability, said the joint statement. The two sides will continue to closely cooperate in local currency swaps and encourage both sides to make greater use of local currency settlements in trade and investment.Beyond bilateral cooperation, analysts noted, this is also a tremendous opportunity to further deepen and expand cooperation between China and Latin America, especially as Argentina is holding the rotating presidency of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in 2022. Countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia that have not yet signed a Belt and Road Memorandum of Understanding may consider accelerating their pace in taking the opportunity,"" Zhou Zhiwei, an expert on Latin American studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.More Latin American countries are joining the BRI. Before Argentina, the governments of China and Nicaragua signed a MoU in January to jointly promote the BRI.Trade cooperation between China and Latin American countries is also expanding. On Sunday, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced that China and Ecuador officially entered into free trade agreement negotiations, aiming to tap into each other's trade potential, optimize value chains, promote trade and investment liberalization, in addition to facilitating and promoting the sustained and diversified development of bilateral trade.Zhou also emphasized that the pragmatic cooperation between China and the Latin American region in trade and investment under the BRI framework will be further elevated while Argentina holds the rotating presidency of the CELAC. Fernandez said that Argentina will continue to actively participate in the BRI cooperation, deepen cooperation in trade, agriculture, infrastructure construction and other fields, and welcome more Chinese enterprises to invest in Argentina. He also stressed that Argentina is willing to work closely with China under the multilateral framework, promote multilateralism, and play a greater role in promoting cooperation between the CELAC and China.Analysts noted that despite slander and interference by the US and some other Western countries, the BRI is welcomed by local people in Latin America. Zhou said that the BRI will benefit people in the Latin America region, especially during the tough period of the global economic recovery. Latin American countries are seeking international cooperation, and the openness of China's policies actually suits their needs better than some Western countries, with more potential to be unleashed, he added. Wang also noted that the BRI is set to meet the needs of local people and help economic development, such as infrastructure construction. ""The BRI is a pragmatic aid to help Latin American countries to advance their economic recovery, not a political tool for great power rivalry,"" said Wang.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251555.shtml,source/economy

A commemorative event was held here on Sunday to mourn the 13,000 lives lost to COVID-19 in Austria.Photo:XinhuaIt's official: Austrians over the age of 18 must be vaccinated against COVID-19 from Saturday or face the possibility of a heavy fine, an unprecedented measure in the European Union (EU).The new measure, adopted on January 20 by Parliament, came into force on Saturday, the culmination of a process that began in November in the face of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.The government decided to pursue its new, tougher approach despite criticism within the country. ""No other country in Europe is following us on compulsory vaccines,"" said Manuel Krautgartner, who has campaigned against the new approach. In neighboring Germany, a similar proposal championed by the new Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz was debated in January in the lower house of parliament but many MPs still oppose the idea.Despite the threat of such a drastic measure, the vaccination rate in Austria has still failed to take off, languishing below the levels seen in France or Spain.The humanitarian association Arbeiter Samariter Bund, which oversees some vaccination sites in the capital Vienna, said there had an uptick in turnout this week. ""We recorded a small increase of around 9 percent compared to last week,"" the organization's manager, Michael Hausmann, told AFP.From the average of around 7,000 injections administered every day in the capital, only 10 percent are a first dose, he said in a statement.Erika Viskancove, a 33-year-old accountant, said she came to a vaccination center situated next to an Art Deco swimming pool to receive her third booster dose. ""I sincerely believe that the law is the best way"" to defeat the pandemic, she said, calling on other countries to follow Austria's lead.Melanie, a 23-year-old waitress who preferred not to give her second name, said she was mainly there to avoid ending up ""locked up at home. ""Non-vaccinated people are currently excluded from restaurants, sports and cultural venues. But from now on they will also be subject to fines, which Melanie said was ""unhealthy. ""The law applies to all adult residents with the exception of pregnant women, those who have contracted the virus within the past 180 days and those with medical exemptions.Checks will begin from mid-March, with fines ranging from 600 to 3,600 euros ($690-$4,100).They will, however, be lifted if the person fined gets vaccinated within two weeks.More than 60 percent of Austrians support the COVID-19 measure, according to a recent survey, but large swathes of the population remain strongly opposed.For several weeks after the announcement of the new law, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against what they regard as a draconian policy.Critics have also questioned the need for compulsion given the milder nature of the Omicron variant.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251528.shtml,world/europe

Photo: Zhao Juecheng/GTInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said on Sunday that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will be the start of a new era for global winter sports, and China's extraordinary achievements in winter sports will change the landscape of winter sports around the world forever. Bach said that Beijing is the first city ever to host both the summer and winter editions of the Olympic Games. China has already made history by surpassing the goal of engaging 300 million Chinese people in winter sports. ""Today, we can say: China is a winter sports country,"" Bach said. Bach made the remarks at an Alibaba cloud hologram event during which Bach, who is in the closed loop in Beijing, had a real-time interaction with Alibaba Group CEO Zhang Yong, who is in Shanghai, through Alibaba Group's cloud computing technology.Before the pandemic, digitalization was already changing the Olympic Games in profound ways. Beijing 2022 will deepen this trend of engaging more people, more digitally than before, Bach said. ""I am sharing the same stage with my dear friend Daniel Zhang, even though I am inside the closed loop and he is outside. This is a perfect example of how digital technology is transforming the way we experience the Olympic Games,"" Bach said. During the interaction between Bach and Zhang, the two together presented a Chinese Spring Festival couplet and Bath also presented Zhang with the Beijing 2022 torch through the cloud service. The technology relies on real-time communication and a global real-time transmission network, and it combines with the advanced 4K high-definition screen to achieve a remote holographic interactive experience. The cloud hologram event was held at the 2022 Beijing Media Center for the Beijing Winter Olympics, which provides information related to the Games for journalists without official Olympic accreditation.Xu Hejian, director of the 2022 Beijing Media Center, said at the event that the cloud service enables the 1,770 journalists at the center to closely interact with Bach, which is not only the strength of technology and the Olympics but also the strength of China.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251547.shtml,china/diplomacy

The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games have brought the world unity, peace, and hope under the shadow of COVID-19, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said during a meeting with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday, while hailing China's great achievements and support in fighting the pandemic.Tedros arrived in China on Thursday for the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics. He said he was glad to come to China for this special moment and be part of the pre-Games torch relay. ""The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games have brought the world unity, peace, and hope under the shadow of COVID-19, and will help the world getting through the hard times,"" he noted. He congratulated China for the remarkable achievements in curbing the epidemic and recognized China's effort in the world's fight against the disease, especially the 600 million doses of vaccines of aid that China offered to Africa and China's donations to COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX,) a global vaccination program led by the WHO. Tedros said that the WHO hopes to strengthen global health cooperation with China and believes China will play an important role in achieving the global target of getting 70 percent of the world's population vaccinated. Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful seat at the WHO, Wang said China has carried out all-round and multi-level cooperation with the WHO and actively supported the organization in dealing with various health crises including Ebola. Wang said he has faith in defeating coronavirus together with the organization as well. Wang said China has overcome its own difficulties and launched the largest emergency humanitarian operation since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, providing over 2.1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations.Wang noted China is willing to further cooperate with the WHO in promoting equitable and affordable access to vaccines in developing countries.

16,2022-02-06,Beijing Winter Olympics: Mankind`s triumph,"Photo: Li Hao/GTAs the Beijing Winter Olympics opened on Friday, with up to 3,000 international athletes and participating officials and twice the number of world leaders as there were in the past summer Olympics attending, and all foreign participants expressing enthusiasm and satisfaction with the preparations and hospitality, we can already say this year's winter Olympics has triumphed - despite the cynical efforts to disrupt it and the challenges posed by the pandemic.Speaking from the perspective of a Filipino and member of the ASEAN, I can say that the enthusiasm for the games in our region is indeed genuine and effusive. Imagine our tropical countries sending our athletes to compete in winter games that we do not have in our countries. For instance, the Philippines is cheering its one-person team of Asa Miller who will be competing in the Alpine Skiing events. He has become quite a celebrity in the country.Among RCEP partners, South Korea, Japan, and Australia send large delegations to the games no matter what some governments say and render politicized perspectives moot and academic. Other ASEAN countries are also ardently participating. It is amazing to see athletes coming from across the globe to be one with the spirit and games of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Delegations have come from Latin America and Caribbean Peru, Chile, Haiti, Trinidad, Tobago. African Eritrea, Ghana, Madagascar, Morocco, and Nigeria are also joining, giving an idea of the extent of enthusiasm and participation. In fact, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation expressed in November 2021 that it ""opposed the politicization of sports. ""The triumph over the pandemic fears is also important to consider and understand. China's scientific and disciplined approach ensures the safety and health of participating athletes and other members of 91 countries participating. Beijing screening has detected 2.9 percent positive tests for athletes and officials before entering the respective Olympic ""loop"" and ""bubble. ""Beijing's anti-COVID-19 preparations cover not only the 3,000 athletes and officials but other guests, such as hundreds of media crews and entourages of foreign dignitaries participating. A gargantuan job is not made any lighter by reports of possible attempts at sabotaging the Games' proficiency and image preparations by malicious elements. Apparently, elements hostile to mankind's solidarity never sleep and are active covertly and overtly.Even as the Anglosphere media continues to drum up their measly reality. The world has all but wholly forgotten the so-called human rights protesters. Shady human rights issues are being raised in meagre protest actions in the West. Still, global enthusiasm and shine for the spirit of solidarity and brotherhood dissipate them into oblivion. The world appreciates China's economic and humanitarian progress for its minorities, often doing better than some among the majority.The pre-opening period was highlighted by the in-person meeting of President Xi Jinping with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach who expressed to President Xi, ""This is the first time for some nations to participate in the Winter Games. It fully shows how the Beijing Olympic Games has been widely supported by the world and the international community is also generally against politicizing sports events. ""The discussion with President Xi also highlighted one aspect that will be vital to the subsequent global pandemic economic recovery, ""The Olympic Winter Games are part of our vision of encouraging 300 million Chinese to experience winter sports. Through sport we will improve the health and well-being of all Chinese people,"" Xi said. Reading between these lines one finds a new factor for economic growth for the Chinese and world economy. In a wonderful metaphor, President Xi said, ""Ice and snow are also as valuable as gold and silver,"" a truly poetic way of describing the economic promise of winter sports for China and the global economic recovery as 300-million Chinese middle class take up the expensive pastime. I suppose that in the next China International Import Exhibition in November 2022, winter sports equipment and apparel will be among the major new items China will look for among its imports from other countries.The official motto for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is ""Together for a Shared Future,"" and indeed it has delivered the message to the seven-billion people of the world cogently and powerfully, reflecting the consensus for unity and collective effort to achieve the historic goals of mankind - of permanent peace and prosperity for all.

The City of Toronto issued an extreme cold weather alert on Monday. (Photo: Xinhua)More demonstrators poured onto the streets of Ottawa and other Canadian cities on Saturday demanding an end to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, as protests against pandemic restrictions entered their second week.In the capital, demonstrators huddled around campfires in bone-chilling temperatures and erected portable saunas and bouncy castles for kids outside Parliament, while waving Canadian flags and shouting anti-government slogans.Their chants of ""freedom"" were met with cries of ""go home"" by a smaller group of counter-protesters fed up with the week-long occupation of the capital.The atmosphere, however, appeared more festive - with dancing and fireworks - than a week earlier, when several protesters waved Confederate flags and Nazi symbols and clashed with locals.The demonstrations, which started out as protests by truckers angry with vaccine requirements when crossing the US-Canadian border, have morphed into broader protests against COVID-19 health restrictions.Police were out in force and put up barriers to limit vehicle access to the city center, as many thousands of protesters - including two on horseback - joined truckers already jamming Ottawa streets.Similar protests were happening in almost every major Canadian city, including Toronto - where a man was charged with assault after throwing a smoke bomb into a crowd.In Winnipeg, a driver was arrested for slamming his SUV into demonstrators. Four people were treated for minor injuries, police said.And in southern Alberta province, truckers continued to block a major border crossing to the US state of Montana.At an emergency meeting late Saturday, Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly requested ""an additional surge of resources"" to bring an end to what police board chair Diane Deans described as a ""siege"" of the capital. ""This group is a threat to our democracy,"" Deans said. ""What we're seeing is bigger than just a city of Ottawa problem, this is a nationwide insurrection. This is madness. ""With public anger rising - thousands of residents have complained of harassment by protesters, and an online petition demanding action has drawn 40,000 signatures - Sloly has faced increased pressure to end what he has called an ""unlawful"" occupation of the city.Reached for comment by AFP, protest coordinator Jim Torma said the protesters would not back down. ""They're not going to hide us,"" Torma said. ""We're going to be in [politicians'] faces as long as it takes"" to force an end to public health restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251522.shtml,world/americas

Experts noted that the successful hosting of the games will not only drive a new wave of ""China mania"" all over the world, but will also show the world that China is determined to open as always. It is some Western countries, especially the US, that have changed, viewing China with a twisted, zero-sum mentality. After hosting a banquet at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Saturday for state leaders and officials from international organizations, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with several foreign dignitaries on Sunday, including Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Polish President Andrzej Duda, Singaporean President Halimah Yacob and President of Argentina Alberto Fernandez.Deepened bilateral cooperation, friendship, contributing to regional and international stability and peaceâ¦ those words topped Xi's remarks when meeting with those dignitaries. Xi told Khan that China is willing to work with Pakistan to accelerate the building of a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, bring benefits to the people of the two countries, provide impetus for regional cooperation and contribute to world peace. When meeting with Duda, Xi called on both sides to tap the potential in fields such as trade and investment, transportation and logistics, as well as high and new technologies to lift bilateral practical cooperation to a new height.He urged both sides to deepen the synergy of development strategies and promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations in the post-pandemic era when meeting with Singapore's Halimah. The spirit of solidarity the Olympic Games want to convey is the most basic common value of humanity. China's diplomacy at this time is also a demonstration of our support for the Olympic spirit and solidarity of the major powers, said experts. ""After more than 40 years of reform and opening-up, we are now most confident in knowing what it stands for and what kind of reform and opening-up will best benefit our development,"" LÃ¼ Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""We have entered an era of independent innovation in an open environment. The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics proves our openness. ""LÃ¼ said that China's expansion of its ""friends circle"" relies on common progress and development, so now a lot of developing countries are working together with and inviting China to participate in the construction of their infrastructure. The signal from such a splendid diplomatic feast at the beginning of 2022 is clear - that is China's development relies on the world, and the world is ushering in more prosperity and hope when it more closely embraces China, said Li Haidong, professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University. New wave of China maniaIn their meeting with Xi, foreign guests extended gratitude to China for help amid the COVID-19 pandemic, expressed their expectation of more and deeper cooperation with China and hailed China's hosting of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.Li said that just like the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics will also stir up a new wave of ""China craze,"" which is not only driven by the spectacular opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, dazzling decoration and careful preparation of the event, but also by China's confident diplomacy, current culture and politics. The Olympics has shone a light on the current state of China, which will attract more and more to take a close look at the East Asian country, Li said.Singaporean President Halimah Yacob said she was honored to attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. The performance at the opening ceremony has fully demonstrated China's outstanding capability and high level in this regard. She believes that the Winter Olympics will be held in a green, safe way and will promote international unity and cooperation. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan also hailed China's effort to eradicate absolute poverty during his meeting with Xi, noting that China's experience in governance is worth learning by every country.

Photo: XinhuaAn anxious WashingtonThe West, however, is looking at China's festivities with a ""sour grapes"" mentality. Some US media and politicians continued to orchestrate efforts to throw mud at the Winter Olympics and China's diplomatic feast.The Voice of America published an article saying that grand opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics shows a China that is drifting further away from the West and The New York Times harped on a meeting between Chinese and Russian leaders, saying it shows a China that is growing impatient, and disdainful, of Western censure.Seeing China is cementing relationships with other countries, the US is anxious to win over Asian allies with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken next week participating in talks with Indo-Pacific allies, including a meeting of foreign ministers of the four-nation QUAD. Western media has been jumping on 2008 Olympics ""nostalgia"" to suggest that China has changed from a country that was ""forward-looking"" to one that is ""tougher against the West and more isolated."" China has not changed. Rather, it is the way Western countries see China that has changed, Li said. He noted that China has been more and more open and it has undertaken the responsibility of upholding multilateralism and globalization when they were in danger.As some Western countries are growing wary of China's growth, they look at China with a narrowing mind, with more antagonism and with a twisted zero-sum mentality, which doubles down every time China makes achievements, or makes more friends, according to Li. LÃ¼ noted that the day for the West, especially the US to get rid of jealousy may yet come, yet they have to get rid of fear and learn to develop together. Judging by the reign of Trump and Biden for now, ""if they just continue to smear China and make no changes, their results will get worse and worse,"" LÃ¼ said.In his speech addressing the Saturday banquet, Xi extended gratitude to the guests for overcoming difficulties and inconvenience during the pandemic to come to Beijing, and cheer for China and the Winter Olympics. The Winter Olympics has mirrored international society's perspective of China. A few try to smear it, but there are also some others that stand together with you defying all the difficulties, said Li, noting that event not only shows the world Chinese people's ability to host the sports feast, but also China's big strides in diplomacy as well as the trends of international society.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251556.shtml,china/diplomacy
21,2022-02-06,"China reveals concept art for armed, aerial refueling-capable variant of Z-20 chopper","An armed, aerial refueling-capable variant of the Z-20 helicopter makes its first appearance to the public in the form of computer-generated imagery in a promotional video of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the maker of the aircraft, in early 2022 that rounds up achievements made in 2021. Photo: Screenshot from the Sina Weibo account of AVICAn armed, aerial refueling-capable variant of China's Z-20 medium-lift utility helicopter is believed to be currently under development after the aircraft's maker recently revealed concept art for such a chopper, observers said on Sunday.The state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the maker of most aircraft used by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), released a promotional video titled ""In the blue sky"" on January 31 on social media platforms, in which the company rounded up the achievements it made in 2021.The title screen of the video displays the three ""20"" series aircraft developed by AVIC, namely the J-20 stealth fighter jet, the Y-20 large transport aircraft and the Z-20 helicopter, in computer-generated imagery.While the computer-generated art for the J-20 and the Y-20 seem identical to their real-life counterparts, the Z-20 looks significantly different to the ones in service with the PLA Army today, as it has a pair of short wings, each carrying four missiles and a multiple rocket launcher. This makes this Z-20 likely an armed assault variant, as the current version of the Z-20 is a utility version for mainly transport missions, and does not have the wings or the weapons, analysts said.Ordnance Industry Science Technology, a defense magazine based in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, reported in January 2021 that the armed variant of the Z-20 was already under development at that time, citing a photo that circulated on social media.In addition, the new Z-20 variant seems to have a long lance-like pole to the right of its nose, according to the latest AVIC video. This pole is likely a refueling probe that allows the chopper to receive aerial refueling, analysts said.Just before AVIC released the video, Deng Jinghui, chief designer of the helicopter, said in an interview with China Central Television, the state broadcaster, in early January that he was considering extending the range of the Z-20 in the form of aerial refueling, since the helicopter's range is limited compared with a fixed-wing aircraft.The current version of the Z-20 is a base version with high utility, and it is highly expected that it would spawn many variants to suit different types of combat needs by the PLA, just as the US has done with its Black Hawk helicopter, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.In addition to armed assault, the Z-20 could also be developed into variants for vessel-based transport, anti-submarine warfare, special operations, search and rescue as well as medical support, the expert predicted.While all the variants will have differences, they share many basic parts and systems, and this will make production and maintenance much easier than developing completely different helicopters for different missions, the expert said, noting that this will also contribute to lowering the cost of the aircraft thanks to economies of scale.Deng said in a separate interview with CCTV in November 2019 that he hoped the Z-20 will break the record in terms of the numbers produced among all Chinese helicopters and remain in service for a long time.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251518.shtml,china/military
22,2022-02-06,China to see moderate CPI growth in 2022 despite global inflationary pressure: NDRC,"CPI Photo: VCGChina's consumer price index (CPI), the main gauge of inflation, is expected to maintain moderate expansion in 2022 and the growth of the producer price index (PPI), or factory-gate prices, will gradually fall, according to an article published by China's top economic planner on Sunday.The article, which was posted on the WeChat account of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said that China's inflationary pressure is expected to weaken due to the country's economic recovery and development, as well as sufficient supplies of coal, oil and staple foods, including vegetables and meat, despite global high inflation.In 2021, many countries faced downside risks, including renewed COVID-19 outbreaks, the possibility of unanchored inflation expectations, and rising debt levels. Inflation in many economies across the world hit record highs, with the CPI in the US rising 4.7 percent throughout the year and reaching 7 percent in December, the highest in nearly 40 years. Its PPI increased 6.9 percent last year.Inflation in some emerging economies, including India and Brazil, also saw multi-year highs in 2021. Turkey's CPI and PPI in December soared to 36 percent and 80 percent, respectively.Amid high inflation pressure around the world, China has made a contribution to balancing supply and demand in international markets and stabilizing global prices, the NDRC said, noting that the country's stable production has strongly supported the smooth operation of global industry and supply chains thanks to the government's effective efforts to control the pandemic.Moreover, the country has insisted on implementing a prudent monetary policy. In response to irrational price rises of commodities like coal, iron ore and steel, the government ramped up efforts to regulate supply and demand, and it strengthened market supervision. These efforts have effectively curbed increases of global prices, the NDRC said.In 2021, China's CPI rose by a moderate 0.9 percent year-on-year, and the growth of the PPI stood at 8.1 percent, which together provide a solid base for China's steady economic growth amid soaring commodity prices and the impact of sporadic flare-ups of COVID-19 across the world. China has become a stabilizer for the global economy facing downward pressure, experts said.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, China's GDP expanded 8.1 percent year-on-year in 2021, which was well above the government target of ""above 6 percent"" set at the beginning of 2021.

23,2022-02-06,China-Pakistan relations to get closer and stronger: Pakistani Prime Minister,"Photos: Courtesy of Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to ChinaEditor's Note: Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is one of the world dignitaries who attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics on Feb 4. The Global Times (GT) reporters Liu Caiyu and Xing Xiaojing spoke to Mr Khan on his visit to Beijing via a virtual exclusive interview on February 5. GT: How do you feel about coming to Beijing to attend the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics? What expectations do you have for China in holding the Games?Khan:I have played almost 20 years of international sport, but since I became the prime minister, I hardly have any time to watch any international sports. So being invited to watch the Winter Olympics was a great pleasure for me. I must say the event was so impressive. I've never seen an event like that, those fireworks and especially the effect of lighting. It was just out of this world.When a country is going up, when it has self-belief, it can reach out to everyone. Only that sort of country can produce the spectacular event I went to last night.This is my fourth visit to Beijing as a prime minister. Many years ago, I came when I was just a politician, a member of parliament. China changes every two years. You can't recognize it. When you come here, you think you're in a different country. I've never seen a country change so quickly in terms of infrastructure. To hold Olympics during the pandemic is one of the most difficult things to do. The only way that one country could do it is that it must have incredible discipline.GT: In the field of winter sports, have China and Pakistan engaged in any collaboration and exchanges? How will the Winter Olympics add momentum to bilateral ties between China and Pakistan?Khan: In Pakistan, there is no tradition of winter sports. Now we are paying attention to winter sports for the first time. The main place where we could exchange winter sports is in remote northern areas that neighbors China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It is China that has helped us to build the Karakoram Highway which links northern areas to other parts of Pakistan. Some of the top 10 highest mountains are in Pakistan. We have high mountains with great skiing slopes. Skardu is right in the northern areas with an international airport. So now, we will have people coming from all over the world.Everyone would be watching live the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics in Pakistan. We have a Pakistani competing in this Olympics; we're coming here to also promote the Olympics in Pakistan.GT: Pakistan-China relationship has been described as that of ""iron brothers."" How do ordinary Pakistanis see China? In 2021, the two countries celebrated the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, what is your expectation for the future of China-Pakistan relations?Khan: Pakistan and China not only see each other as iron brothers, but they also think that China and Pakistan relationship is as high as the Himalayas. It's the people-to-people relationship. When you have people to people relationship, it means governments can come and go, but the relationship will always stay because it's embedded in the people of the two countries.China and Pakistan relationship goes back 70 years, and it's an all-weather relationship. We have stood with each other throughout the 70 years. With other countries, sometimes we've had good relationships, and have periods of not so good relationships with them, but with China it's been consistent for 70 years.When the Pakistan contingent was walking in, there was applause in the stadium. Apart from China that received the biggest applause, Pakistan is among the countries that got probably the next biggest applause in the stadium. We were all very impressed and pleased by that.China-Pakistan ties will get stronger and stronger in the future, because of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is something that connects Pakistan and China, part of the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping. CPEC is not just going to connect us, not just about road connectivity, but about cooperation, industrialization, agriculture and tourism, so the relationship between the two countries will just get closer and stronger.GT: What potential development of the CPEC should we expect in 2022? Khan: The first phase of CPEC was connectivity. As CPEC moved into the second phase it means special economic industrial zones, agriculture, which is Pakistan's backbone. The main employer in Pakistan is agriculture. We expect China to help us increase our productivity in agriculture, then in information, technology and IT. Technology is the future. We are inviting Chinese companies to come to Special Technology Zones, and operate these technology zones. Apart from that, tourism is going to be the future because of interaction between people of the two countries and the connectivity.GT: The Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene the 20th National Congress of the CPC in Beijing in the second half of 2022. What's your assessment of the achievements the CPC has brought to China and the world over the years? Khan: CPC has achieved the greatest achievements in the history of mankind. CPC has lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty in the last 30 to 40 years. Last year Xi announced the end of extreme poverty in China. There can be no greater achievement than this. This has to be the greatest achievement of any civilization.This is where, certainly we in Pakistan, want to learn from China. We're already learning, we are trying to follow the Chinese model. How do we get people out of poverty? For me, the biggest challenge of a government is to take care of the people who are at the bottom of the social structure. Civilizations are not judged by how the rich people live, it's how the poor people live.The other thing about China that strikes me is the culture of meritocracy. Party School of CPC explained to me how they bring their best people and utilize their talents. That is a very, very impressive thing about China. Any society that has meritocracy will beat those societies which do not have it.Another thing that I find fascinating about China is the discipline of its society. No other society has such kind of discipline. Again, coming back to the way China's dealing with COVID-19, when you look around the world, no society is dealt with COVID-19 like China has. When you look at Europe, the US and other countries, there are demonstrations against restrictions, against lockdowns. But in China, because the people believe in the government and believe that the government looks after them, they impose discipline on themselves. That's a very impressive treat in China.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251538.shtml,opinion/asianreview

25,2022-02-06,Chinese provinces survey parents on subsidies to have more than one child during Special Festival,"photo:CFPDuring the Spring Festival, a number of localities across China including East China's Zhejiang Province and South China's Hainan Province have carried out questionnaires on possible second-child and third-third subsidizing by provincial governments, to help meet the rising demographic challenge as the country's net population increase in 2021 hit a 60-year low. Zhejiang has released a questionnaire on the cost of raising infants under the age of three, in which the parents were asked whether to have their two or three children assuming the government provides a subsidy of 1,000 yuan ($157.2) per month.The questionnaire also asked about the monthly cost of food, nutritional supplements and household costs for infants in 2021, as well as questions about the average daily care time for the parents and grandparents.In addition, Hainan has conducted a questionnaire on fertility policy, asking the parents whether they would consider having two or three children if the government provided a monthly subsidy of 500 yuan for children under the age of three.The questionnaires came after that the National Bureau of Statistics released the country's population data in 2021, showing that China's birth rate fell below 1 percent for the second year in a row, and the net population increase in 2021 had fallen to its lowest level since 1962.In response to the significant decline of population, many localities in China have implemented second-child subsidies in 2021.In July last year, Panzhihua city in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, issued childcare subsidies for families with two or three children, with a monthly subsidy of 500 yuan per child under the age of three. In other words, starting from the second child, each child can receive a total of 18,000 yuan in subsidies. Panzhihua was not the only place to release second-child subsidy in China.In September last year, Linze County in Northwest China's Gansu Province issued a policy to encourage child-bearing for long-term balanced population growth, proposing a total of 11 specific support measures including the issuance of fertility allowance, childcare subsidy and housing purchase subsidy.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251502.shtml,source/economy
26,2022-02-06,Climate justice,"Replanted grass grows on a hillock at Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary situated in the Western Ghat mountains in Kerala's Wayanad District, India on September 16, 2021. Photo: AFP P. K. Madhavan stood proudly next to a young, sturdy mahogany tree, one of 100 he planted three years ago on his farm in Wayanad district in the southern Indian state of Kerala.Madhavan's two acres (0.8 hectares) of land in Meenangadi village used to be lush with cash crops - coffee, black pepper and betel nut - but two decades of drought and unseasonally heavy rain have decimated his yields.Now the mahogany plantation is one of his only reliable sources of income, earning him up to 5,000 rupees ($67) a year - and all he has to do is to keep the trees standing.The 84-year-old farmer is being paid to plant and protect trees through a ""tree banking"" scheme, the project at the heart of Meenangadi's campaign to become India's first carbon-neutral village by 2025.Madhavan got his saplings for free from Meenangadi's panchayat, or village council, which will lend him 50 rupees per tree for every year he does not cut it down until 2031.At that point, the loan is written off and he can do what he likes with the trees, including felling them to sell for timber. ""Every morning, I spend some time looking after these trees. I am really happy to say that except for three [which died naturally], all are steadfastly growing,"" Madhavan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Sooner or later, my land will become a small forest filled with infinite greenery. ""Over the past decade, Kerala's farmers have faced an ailing business struggling with rising temperatures and erratic rains, while deforestation has caused soil degradation, making their land more vulnerable to flooding and mudslides.Wayanad district is suffering more than most, with the Kerala State Action Plan on Climate Change naming it as one of the state's four hot spots.Tree-planting initiatives are taking root worldwide as governments and corporations look for ways to cut planet-warming emissions, and fight pollution and land degradation - or simply to earn credits to offset their carbon emissions.But many projects fail when they rely on locals with little time or money to look after newly planted trees.Meenangadi's tree-banking project avoids that pitfall by giving farmers an ongoing incentive to protect trees, said C. Jayakumar, executive director of Thanal, a local environmental group helping implement the village's carbon-neutral program. ""The message here is that climate change is being linked with climate justice,"" he said.Money grows on treesWhen Meenangadi started its carbon-cutting journey in 2016, an energy audit indicated the village population of 33,450 was generating 15,000 tons of excess carbon every day.To help bring that number down to zero within the next four years, the aim is to plant at least 350,000 trees to soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, said K.E. Vinayan, president of the village council.A farmer who joins up is given tree saplings grown in the council's nursery or donated by the Kerala Forest Department.Ranging from trees for timber and fruit to bamboo, most are native species chosen for their ability to absorb large amounts of carbon and withstand wild weather swings, as well as to generate an income for farmers once they mature, Vinayan said.Three years after planting, the farmer can mortgage the trees for a 10-year interest-free loan from the council which only has to be paid back if any of the trees are cut down.If a tree dies due to disease, heavy rain or drought, the farmer continues to receive money for it, Vinayan added.So far, 780 farmers have enrolled in the scheme and the village has planted 172,000 saplings, including on vacant lots and those handed out to farmers who support the net-zero push but do not want to join the tree-banking project.It has already distributed 350,000 rupees in the first tranche of loans, with the second tranche coming soon, boosted by a 100 million rupee grant from Kerala state.While a first survey is still underway, Vinayan said as far as he knows, none of the trees have been cut down.But it is vital that farmers be allowed to use their trees however they want at the end of their loan period, because ""they are the real owners and custodians of the trees,"" he noted.The council will regularly review the project with a view to extending the mortgage period or launching a new scheme to incentivize farmers to preserve their plantations, he added.Village inspirationEven if most farmers joining Meenangadi's project decide to leave their trees standing, many environmentalists warn tree-planting drives are not nearly enough to slow planetary warming.G. Balagopal, an environmentalist and committee member of scientific organization Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad, said he supported the tree-banking scheme but it had limitations. ""Climate change is a global phenomenon - it can't be mitigated by massive tree-planting in a particular region,"" he said.The benefits of planting trees are canceled out if the carbon they pull from the air is replaced by greenhouse gases coming from cars, household heating and power sources, he said.Meenangadi council members said they were looking at other ways to bring down carbon emissions, including shifting to solar lighting and electric vehicles and using high-efficiency stoves.And the village's climate ambitions are spreading. The governing council for Sulthan Batheri Block, the district sub-division where Meenangadi is located, launched its own net-zero program in January. ""Meenangadi's carbon-neutral mission has really inspired us,"" said C. Assainar, president of the Sulthan Batheri Block Panchayat.For Madhavan in Meenangadi, the village's plan offers hope that he and his fellow farmers could help calm the erratic weather that has turned Wayanad district from an agricultural champion to a region in crisis.Reuters",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251534.shtml,world/asia-pacific

Photo: VCGThe splendid opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games amazed the world on Friday. The Winter Olympic Games now are going smoothly, and as previously scheduled. This is a huge slap in the face of some forces in the West that planned to sabotage the Games. This includes some ""human rights experts"" who have been making all efforts to persuade athletes to ""boycott"" the Beijing Winter Olympics.However, even after the successful start of the Games, they would not stop putting on a show about China's ""human rights issues."" According to Fox News, some of these ""experts"" now are concerned about ""Olympic athletes' self-censoring."" They believe that even after the Beijing Games are over, some athletes funded by major US companies with close ties to the Chinese market may be forced not to speak out against ""human rights abuses"" in China ""in the interest of money. ""Even US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn't miss the chance to bash China. Before the opening ceremony, she warned US athletes not to anger the ""ruthless"" Chinese government by staging political protests.However, Pelosi is right about this one thing in her speech: The athletes are in Beijing to compete. In fact, even though Rule 50 in the Olympic Charter has offered more freedom of expression to athletes, it stipulates that ""No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas."" And to the disappointment of those anti-China forces in the West, most of the athletes expressed positive emotions such as joy and surprise on social media platforms after they arrived in Beijing. Obviously, the ""best"" wishes from those forces to the Beijing Winter Olympics failed to come true.LÃ¼ Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times he believes that some people in the US, especially some media people and lawmakers, have been trying to use the Beijing Olympics to create political conflicts and even social unrest on a certain scale. These forces cannot stand any of China's achievements, therefore, they always try to nitpick over Beijing's success. This actually demonstrates the US is declining.Yet, Washington still focuses on how to smear its rivals and bring down their competitiveness instead of worrying about how to enhance its own. ""It's like the US, already in the gutter, tries to pull China down into the gutter as well, making China equally dirty,"" LÃ¼ said.It seems that the US and some other Western countries are keen on undermining the Olympic Games in China. In 2008, they used the Tibet affairs as an excuse to obstruct the torch relay, with efforts greater than this time. Nevertheless, they still failed to block the Summer Olympics in Beijing. In LÃ¼'s opinion, the attempts of these forces have also fallen flat this year, and the so-called diplomatic boycott or efforts to instigate athletes to stir up trouble turn out to be futile.Despite that, these people refuse to stop attacking China, which is why they are now turning to speculation about China's interference with US athletes' ""freedom of expression"" after the Beijing 2022 Winter Games. It is ridiculous that they hype the idea of ""blaming it all on China,"" even if the athletes themselves choose to remain silent on China-related affairs.The attacks on China are just another example that the US has premeditated a plan to crack down on its opponents. According to LÃ¼, the West, especially the US, has been preparing to smear China over the Winter Olympic Games since 2018, starting with the hyping of ""human rights abuses"" in China's Xinjiang region. But now it seems they have gained little effect. ""We should not expect Washington to give up such practices, as it always uses human rights issues as a stick to beat their competitors and it will not stop wielding it any time sooner. But the power of this weapon will get weaker and weaker. It is clear that it will become, as former US president Richard Nixon wrote in his last book, 'irrelevant,' and eventually, 'laughable,'"" commented LÃ¼ the Chinese expert.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251550.shtml,opinion/observer

(Photo: Xinhua)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday will embark on his tour to the Asia-Pacific region for the Quad meeting in an attempt to push back against China's expanding influence. However, experts on Sunday said huge uncertainties linger for reaching any consensus with real meaning among Asian countries, and that forming the Quad into a more integrated or stronger alliance is impossible.Experts believe Blinken's tour amid a mounting crisis over Ukraine implies the US still places going against China as its top priority. However, the US's scheme to promote economy-related affairs within the security mechanism to target China may not allure Quad members due to doubts toward the US. Other than pointing fingers at China's internal affairs, any consensus with real meaning is not expected to be reached, experts predicted. During his tour next week, Blinken is scheduled to have talks with Indo-Pacific allies, including a meeting of foreign ministers of the four-nation Quad, according to the US State Department. The Quad meeting, with members the US, Japan, India and Australia, will be held in Australia. Blinken is scheduled to depart Washington on Monday, and stay in Australia from February 9 to 12 for the Quad meeting. Later, he will visit Fiji before heading to Hawaii to meet with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts to discuss the North Korea issue.Blinken still decided to visit Asia in spite of the severe situation in Ukraine implies that the focal point of US strategy targeting China remain unchanged, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday.One of the top items for the Quad meeting is whether the US will promote agendas like the economy within the Quad mechanism as the Biden administration said last year the US deeply believes every agenda could be taken to launch competition with China, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.However, there are many uncertainties over whether the assumption from the US can be realized as it has wished, and whether the US can consolidate the quadripartite security dialogue mechanism and run it effectively, Li said. No matter what the Biden administration does, odds are great that the policy would be changed significantly if Biden's Democrats lose the midterm elections in November and if the 2024 presidential election brings in a new Republican administration which advocates economic protectionism, Li explained. Such uncertainty is clear to all other Quad members, thus the US's plan of adopting economy-related affairs within the security mechanism to target China may not reach consensus, Li noted.Xin predicted it is likely the Quad will release statements on China's internal affairs, including South China Sea and the Taiwan question as it usually does after a meeting, but the group moving forward to an integration and stronger alliance is impossible.Xin explained that China constitutes no threat to the countries within the Quad, even as China is continuing to add impetus to its economy, thus, it is unlikely that Japan, India or Australia will opt to become the spearhead of the US to entirely go against China.Blinken's visit to Asia comes amid the mounting crisis over Ukraine. ""We can tell from Blinken's trip that the US is clear the Ukraine crisis is not as dire as US media has been hyping, which has hyped the lie that 'Russia invaded Ukraine.' Meddling in Ukraine issues is more like leverage for the US to gain influence in Europe,"" Xin said. He noted that for the US, a chaotic Ukraine will benefit itself to rope in European allies and at the same time pressure Russia.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251549.shtml,china/diplomacy

Analysts pointed out that the quality and amount of Indian coal remain unclear.The Reuters' report cited sources stating that Coal India, a state-owned coal miner, planned to export some coal to Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan to follow India's ""neighborhood first"" foreign policy.However, Wang Yongzhong, head of the Institute of World Economics and Politics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday that as one of the world largest coal consumers, Indian coal may not be the best choice for the other major coal importers in the region. ""Major coal buyers such as China, Japan and South Korea in the region used to import coal from Indonesia, Russia and Australia with acceptable price and quality,"" said Wang.According to the report, nearly three fourths of India's electricity is generated by coal and the country is suffering from a routine regional power crunch.Wang noted that the volume on global coal market is abundant at present and the exported coal from India may be used for adjustment for its domestic energy source reserves, therefore India's coal export will barely impact the supply and demand on the global market.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251521.shtml,source/economy
31,2022-02-06,Israel dispute on agenda at African Union major summit,"External view of the African Union Conference Center and Office Complex in Addis Ababa Photo: VCG Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh on Saturday urged the African Union to withdraw Israel's accreditation, bringing simmering tensions to a head as the 55-member bloc opened a two-day summit in Addis Ababa.Even as the continent reels from a spate of military coups and the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship with Israel is expected to figure prominently during the summit this weekend.The row broke out in July 2021 when Moussa Faki Mahamat, chair of the African Union Commission, accepted Israel's accreditation to the bloc, triggering a rare dispute within a body that values consensus.As heads of state gathered in Ethiopia's capital on Saturday, Shtayyeh called on the body to reject Faki's move. ""Israel should never be rewarded for its violation and for the apartheid regime it does impose on the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""Your excellencies, I'm sorry to report to you that the situation of the Palestinian people has only grown more precarious. ""The summit may see a vote on whether to back or reject Faki's decision, which could yield an unprecedented split in the bloc.Israel's accreditation in 2021 drew protest from powerful members, including South Africa and Algeria which argued that it flew in the face of AU statements supporting the Palestinian territories. Earlier Saturday, Faki said the AU's commitment to the Palestinian push for independence was ""unchanging and can only continue to go stronger. ""He defended Israel's accreditation, saying it could be ""an instrument in the service of peace"" while calling for ""a serene debate"" on the issue.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251531.shtml,world/africa
32,2022-02-06,Morocco in shock after tragic death,"Bystanders watch as Moroccan emergency teams work to rescue 5-year-old boy Rayan Oram from a well shaft he fell into on February 1, 2022 in the remote village of Ighrane in the rural northern province of Chefchaouen, Morocco on February 5, 2022. Photo: AFPMorocco was in shock Sunday after emergency crews found a 5-year-old boy dead at the bottom of a well in a tragic end to a painstaking five-day rescue operation that gripped the nation and the world.The ordeal of ""little Rayan"" since he fell down the well on Tuesday afternoon gained global attention and sparked an outpouring of sympathy online, with the Arabic hashtag #SaveRayan trending.Throughout the operation to extricate him from the bottom of the 32-meter well shaft, authorities had cautioned that they did not know whether he was alive.And reflecting the emotions provoked by the drama, it was Morocco's royal cabinet that announced he had been found dead. ""Following the tragic accident which cost the life of the child Rayan Oram, His Majesty King Mohammed VI called the parents of the boy who died after falling down the well,"" the royal court said.By mid-afternoon Saturday, rescue crews, using bulldozers and front-end loaders, had excavated the surrounding red earth down to the level where the boy was trapped, and drill teams began creating a horizontal tunnel to reach him from the side. But progress slowed to a snail's pace as the drill teams worked by hand to avoid any vibrations that might bring the brittle soil down on the stricken child, local authorities said.AFP correspondents saw the boy's parents walk down the slope into the horizontal tunnel, visibly crushed, before returning and boarding an ambulance without saying a word.After a period of confusion, a crowd of onlookers began dispersing in somber silence.The family was yet to announce the date of the funeral, but according to Muslim tradition it must take place soon, in principle as early as Sunday.Tributes poured in in the wake of the news that the rescue efforts had failed to recover Rayan alive. ""I want to say to the family of little Rayan and to the Moroccan people that we share your pain,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Facebook. ""Rayan's courage will stay in our memories and continue to inspire us,"" wrote AC Milan's Algerian midfielder Ismael Bennacer in a tweet accompanied by a drawing of a child being lifted into the sky, carried by a heart-shaped balloon marked with the colors of Morocco. ""We all of us had been holding out hope that little Rayan would make it,"" Moroccan-American novelist Laila Lalami wrote on Twitter. ""This is all so tragic. ""Thousands of people had gathered and even camped in solidarity around the site in recent days, where AFP reporters have said the tension has been palpable.Some had applauded to encourage the rescuers, sang religious songs or prayed, chanting in unison ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest).Workers had tried to get oxygen and water down to the child but it was not clear whether he was able to use them, AFP correspondents reported.The shaft, just 45 centimeters across, was too narrow for the boy to be reached directly, and widening it was deemed too risky - so earth-movers dug a wide slope into the hill to reach him from the side.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251515.shtml,world/africa

""We all have a duty to do everything we can to protect our communities with all the tools that science and medicine have given us,"" Ardern said in a pre-recorded speech. ""Togetherness is something we have shown throughout the last few years. I know it hasn't always been easy ... But together we have, and we continue to, overcome.

34,2022-02-06,Olympic partners launch NFT collections,"Photo taken on Feb. 4, 2022 shows a cauldron holding the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. (Photo: Xinhua)Several Chinese business partners of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games have launched non-fungible token (NFT) collections, non-interchangeable digital assets stored on a blockchain, during the Games, a move experts say will boost the popularity of the industry. Alibaba Group, worldwide partner of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), officially released a limited NFT collection of cloud emblems of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games on Saturday.The collection features four sports events - short track speed skating, figure skating, freestyle skiing, and snowboard slopestyle. The collections interweave Chinese traditional elements such as ink painting and the yin and yang in their designs. Each of the four designs is limited to 8,888 pieces. ""Each piece has a unique sequence. It is traceable and can be permanently preserved with high collection value. It is hoped the collection can spark people's curiosity to explore the virtual world,"" Alibaba Group said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Sunday.ANTA, a brand that is an official partner of the Chinese Olympic Committee, also released two NFT products regarding the Chinese delegation's clothes at the Beijing Winter Olympics on January 25. Each of the digital collections is limited to 500 pieces.According to the brand, this is not only an innovative move for a Chinese sports brand to debut an NFT relevant to the Chinese national team, but also a continuous exploration of future consumer experience. There is no doubt that 2022 will be a boom year for NFTs as big institutions and auction houses have stepped into the market, experts said.The nature of the NFT is a unique digital product based on blockchain technology to ensure its unique nature, and because of its uniqueness, it is a collectible and people would buy it and hold it for a very long time with value-added opportunities and artistic value, Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent analyst told the Global Times on Sunday.NFT has gotten a boost in popularity as an important application of blockchain and important component of the metaverse, Liu said. ""It is also inseparable from the speculation of capital and institutional speculation, as well as the portfolios of some investors,"" Liu added.Data from Dune Analytics showed that the largest NFT marketplace OpenSea, which usually accounts for more than 90 percent of the total NFT trading volume, saw its transaction volume on the Ethereum blockchain record its highest monthly volume in January.However experts warned that there could be bubble in the industry. ""Although the NFT is a unique kind of digital art, its value is difficult to measure without a unified scale, which can cause a lot of speculation,"" Liu said.Other challenges lie in whether art creators support the form of the NFT and whether it can avoid becoming a tool for money-laundering, Wang Zhantao, an independent analyst on web security, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""If such problems can be prevented, the blockchain anti-counterfeiting technology can solve the situation in the art market where good and bad are mixed together, and usher in a revival of the art market,"" Wang said.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251540.shtml,source/economy
35,2022-02-06,"RCEP to boost trade among China, South Korea and Japan","RCEP Photo: XinhuaWith the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement coming into force for South Korea at the beginning of February, regional trade and economic cooperation among China, Japan and South Korea - the three major economies in East Asia - are expected to embrace new growth engines within the framework of the mega deal, bringing hope amid the ongoing pandemic and multiple global uncertainties.Since the RCEP came into effect in China and Japan in January, it became the first free trade agreement (FTA) that fully includes China, Japan and South Korea, which is significant for regional economic cooperation and integration of East Asia, Chinese experts said.The mega deal will reduce the tariff costs of cross-border trade among its members and lead to facilitating measures such as self-declaration of origin by approved exporters.Cherry Group, a large garment manufacturer based in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, obtained the first RCEP certificate of origin for South Korea on February 1. As a result, the company's exports could enjoy tax relief of more than 10,000 yuan ($1,572) annually at customs clearance in South Korea, with the tariff rate being cut in half to 6.5 percent, a company representative told the Global Times on Sunday.The company's annual exports to South Korea reach more than 22 million yuan. Thanks to the favorable tariff reduction policy under the RCEP, it is estimated that its annual tariff costs in the South Korean market could be reduced by more than 1.4 million yuan, which would directly drive its exports to South Korea up about 10 percent on a yearly basis, according to the representative.An employee surnamed Wang at an exporter of aquatic products in Shandong told the Global Times on Sunday that after the RCEP deal took effect in South Korea, the tariff on its exports to South Korea was further reduced, boosting the company's profits.Wang said that China also announced preferential policies to promote bilateral trade, including the China-South Korea FTA, which came into effect in 2015.The RCEP offers additional support for bilateral trade on top of those under the China-Korea FTA. For example, under the RCEP, China promises to immediately implement zero tariffs on some chemical products, zero tariffs on mechanical products in the 10th year after it takes effect, and zero tariffs on auto components in phases.In 2021, China-South Korea trade hit about 2.34 trillion yuan, up 18.4 percent year-on-year, Chinese customs data showed. South Korea has become China's fifth-largest trading partner. For South Korea, the RCEP will be conducive for pushing bilateral trade and investment to a high-quality development stage, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. ""Through the mega deal, free trade ties have been forged between China and Japan, and Japan and South Korea, which will have a positive influence for the three parties in exploring an FTA,"" Zhao Gancheng, a research fellow at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.The three countries are expected to achieve more economic synergy and cooperation in East Asia, and that's expected to bring hope to a global economy that is facing multiple uncertainties amid the pandemic, Zhao said. ""If facilitating measures under the RCEP deal accelerate implementation, it will bring real benefits for the three nations,"" he noted.The RCEP agreement has been widely applauded in the Asia-Pacific region as an important step toward deeper regional integration and a source of renewed momentum for global free trade and multilateralism.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251539.shtml,source/economy
36,2022-02-06,Rumors behind `China debt trap`: How Western and Indian conspiracists smear China-Sri Lanka cooperation,"Chinese and Sri Lankan national flags are seen at Colombo's Port City during the visit of Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on January 9, 2022. Photo: VCG After Sri Lanka declared an economic emergency and asked China for help at the beginning of the year, some Western and Indian conspiracists once again went on a bashing spree against China and its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). By maliciously tying Sri Lanka's recent financial distress to the Chinese investment in the country, they got busy hyping the so-called ""Chinese debt trap"" in an attempt to mislead the public and attack the China-Sri Lanka cooperation.Some users created and spread rumors on social media in January that ""China's central bank issued bank notes with a face value of 10,000 rupees in Sri Lanka,"" which was later refuted. This misinformation insinuates China's violation of Sri Lanka's currency sovereignty, smearing the mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the two sides as an ""unequal plunder"" by China, observers told the Global Times.With either rumors about currency sovereignty or the so-called ""China debt trap,"" some Western countries, led by the US, and India have been attacking China's overseas construction projects. However, their clichÃ©s have rarely been echoed in BRI countries, Chinese and Sri Lankan scholars said.China is a good friend ""with consistent economic policies, good trade practices and a win-win attitude,"" Samitha Hettige, advisor of the National Education Commission of Sri Lanka, mentioned in his article published in December on Sri Lanka's English-language newspaper, Ceylon Today. ""Sri Lanka-China relations are quite strong, only based on friendship and nothing to do with [business or politics],"" Hettige told the Global Times.Disinformation campaignThe rumor about currency sovereignty went rife earlier in January, coinciding with Wang's visit to Sri Lanka. One of the earliest rumormongers was a Twitter user under the name ""bandhini fernando"" who frequently posts anti-China misinformation, the Global Times found. On January 9, ""bandhini fernando"" posted two fake pictures of ""Sri Lanka's new 10,000 rupees note"" saying it was issued by the People's Bank of China. ""Wang Yi officially handed over new currency to Sri Lanka during his meeting with [Sri Lankan] President,"" bandhini fernando wrote. The user claimed that the ""new bank note"" can be used in Sri Lanka and wickedly described the Chinese-invested projects of Colombo Port City and Hambantota Port as ""Chinese territory. ""The rumor was refuted the following day by Sri Lankan fact-checking agency Factcrescendo, which quoted a response by the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, CJP Siriwardana, as saying that the bank currently has no plans to issue a 10,000 rupees bank note and the highest currency value in Sri Lanka remains 5,000 rupees. The ""China debt trap,"" an old accusation though, is another defamation campaign by the West and India against China-Sri Lanka's economic cooperation.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by saying that the accusations are not true. ""China-Sri Lanka cooperation is mutually beneficial and has been warmly welcomed by all sectors in Sri Lanka,"" said the ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on January 10.There is no such thing as a ""China debt trap,"" noted Hettige. ""The total Chinese loans only account for a little more than 10 percent of our total loan property portfolio, and China is actually the fourth largest [creditor], behind international capital markets, multilateral development banks and Japan,"" he told the Global Times, highlighting that ""the media did not show the fact. ""US and India's roleThe US and India play a major role in the slandering campaign against China-Sri Lanka cooperation and China-funded projects in the country, observers found. ""Sri Lanka has not fallen into a debt trap,"" President of Sri Lanka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, once stressed in the presence of then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as Sri Lanka's news site Ada Derana reported in October 2020. Readers often see mainstream American newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Foreign Policy and The Atlantic, publish articles blathering about the alleged ""China debt trap."" Responding to the smears and attacks, Rajapaksa said in an official statement in October 2020 that ""constructing a port in Hambantota is an idea of Sri Lanka and not China's."" He also added that the project has a vast potential for generating income and employment opportunities for his country. ""The US frequently defames China-invested projects in Sri Lanka, partly to hope that Sri Lanka will abandon [the BRI] and opt for the [aid plans] the US offers,"" said Qian Feng, Director of the Research Department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University. ""Some Indian government officials and reporters always regard South Asia as India's 'sphere of influence,' wary of the so-called 'outside forces' developing relations with other countries in the region,"" Qian said while highlighting that ""with hostility toward China, they see China's cooperation with countries like Sri Lanka a weakening of India's power of influence there.""",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251536.shtml,china/diplomacy

At 1 pm on Sunday, a 300-meter line was moving slowly in front of a licensed flagship merchandise store on Wangfujing pedestrian street in Beijing to buy souvenirs, particularly the mascot. Some people even brought chairs for the long line. ""I have been waiting in line for nearly four hours and I came for Bing Dwen Dwen,"" a shopper told the Global Times, adding that she came to buy the souvenirs to celebrate the first gold medal won by Team China in short track speedskating on Saturday. ""I think people want to get souvenirs and other items for the Winter Olympic Games, and I'm here to buy for my wife's relatives in Shanghai,"" a foreign national waiting on line told the Global Times. ""We've been told that there's a big variety of things, and I think the most popular one may be the mascot Bing Dwen Dwen, and the one for the Paralympic Games (Shuey Rhon Rhon) as well,"" he said. According to the flagship store on Saturday, daily sales of Beijing 2022 merchandise hit a record high of nearly 3 million yuan ($470,000) on Friday, the day of the opening ceremony. Amid robust sales and long lines, the store implemented restrictions on the number of purchases by individual consumers and encouraged consumers to avoid peak hours.Bing Dwen Dwen, the cuddly mascot for the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games, topped Chinese social media after the opening ceremony on Friday. As of 5 pm on Sunday, the topic ""Bing Dwen Dwen"" had attracted 2.15 billion views on Sina Weibo. Among all the hot searches across China during the Spring Festival holidays on JD.com, a major e-commerce platform, searches for Bing Dwen Dwen accounted for 90 percent, the company told the Global Times on Sunday. More than 10 million users had searched for the mascot on the platform. Bing Dwen Dwen is a panda wearing an ice suit, which looks like an astronaut and demonstrates China's embrace of the future and technology. Chosen from over 5,800 submissions from China and 35 countries and regions as part of a global competition arranged by the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee, the mascot gained popularity not just in China but also overseas. Responding to hot demand for the mascot, Zhao Weidong, a spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee, told a press conference on Sunday that officials are coordinating with relevant parties to increase the supply of Bing Dwen Dwen items, and the tight supply of the souvenirs came as manufacturing plants remained shut for the week-long Spring Festival holidays. Nantong Jinfenghuang Crafts Toy Manufacturing Co, based in East China's Jiangsu Province, one of the three producers of mascot souvenirs, said there is no stock in the plant and the company will resume production starting from Tuesday, media reports said. ""Shoppers' enthusiasm for mascot souvenirs surpassed that in 2008. I have never seen a mascot toy that was out of stock,"" Zhang Qing, CEO of Key Solution Sports Co, a consulting firm for the sports industry in China, told the Global Times on Sunday.The Beijing 2022 event came during the Spring Festival holidays, when Chinese people tend to send gifts and buy new clothes and that provided an opportunity for the marketing of Olympic merchandise, Zhang noted. Take the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games as an example, Olympic-related products generated revenue of $160 million, the Chengdu Economic Daily reported. Shanxi Securities estimated the revenue of licensed souvenir products alone will surpass 2.5 billion yuan during the Beijing 2022 Games. In addition to mascot souvenirs, down jackets and tiger-shaped hats and shoes worn by attendees at the opening ceremony have also gained popularity in China. The Lunar New Year is the Year of the Tiger. Chinese sportswear brand Anta saw its down jacket sales up 203 percent from Friday night to Saturday noon compared with the same period last year on JD.com. An Anta down jacket worn by International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach at the opening ceremony also gained widespread popularity on JD.com, with growing inquiries, according to customer service representatives from the platform.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251545.shtml,source/economy

The Republic will not erase any trace or name from its history. It will not forget any of its works. It will not tear down any statues. ""Amboise mayor Thierry Boutard said he was ""ashamed"" of those responsible and decided to proceed with the inauguration ceremony regardless.Police said no one had claimed responsibility for the vandalism.The sculpture was commissioned to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Algeria's independence from France, won after a brutal eight-year liberation war that continues to poison relations between the two countries.It was proposed by historian Benjamin Stora, who was tasked by President Macron with coming up with ways to heal the memories of the war and 132 years of French rule in Algeria.

""The Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust is pleased to confirm that the Endurance22 Expedition, which is aiming to locate, survey and film the wreck of Endurance... has departed on schedule from Cape Town, headed for the Weddell Sea in Antarctica,"" the expedition's organizers announced.As part of the renowned polar explorer's Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition between 1914 and 1917, Endurance was meant to make the first land crossing of Antarctica, but it fell victim to the Weddell Sea. Just east of the Larsen ice shelves on the Antarctic peninsula, it became ensnared in sea-ice for over 10 months before being crushed and sinking some 3,000 meters below the surface.The voyage is something of a legend, due to the miraculous escape Shackleton and his crew made on foot and in boats.The crew managed to escape by camping on the sea ice until it ruptured. They then launched life boats to Elephant Island and then South Georgia Island, a British overseas territory that lies around 1,400 kilometers east of the Falkland Islands.The South African icebreaker S.A.

40,2022-02-06,Taiwan island blindly follows US; cries `bullying` in an act of self-pity amid China-Russia talks,"The night view of Taipei, Southeast China's Taiwan, June 20, 2019. Photo: XinhuaAs China and Russia agreed on closer strategic coordination at the beginning of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the Taiwan island on Saturday condemned the timing of China and Russia's ""no limits"" partnership as ""contemptible,"" saying the Chinese mainland was ""bringing shame to the spirit of the Games. ""This ridiculous outburst by Taiwan once again highlights its identity myth. Taiwan has always considered itself a so-called ""country."" The international community, however, recognizes it as a part of China. In fact, Taiwan itself participated in the Beijing Winter Olympics as a region under the name of Chinese Taipei within the United Nations framework. Taiwan has been manipulating identity politics and the ideological opposition of ""democracy"" versus ""authoritarianism"" all these years, going so far as to ignore the facts. What is hard to understand is how the joint statement issued by China and Russia could trigger a mysterious ""trauma"" for the Taiwan island. What is in Taiwan island's way when the heads of China and Russia meet and talk about cooperation? It is simply inexplicable. But Taiwan at present has reached the point where it will oppose anything related to the Chinese mainland regardless of what is right or wrong. It opposes everything the Chinese mainland does and disguises it as an ideological confrontation, which has been a habitual operation of the island's leader Tsai Ing-wen and has intensified over the years. In addition to promoting its infamous ""Taiwan secession,"" the Taiwan authorities complained about the ""arrogance and bullying"" of the Chinese mainland and alleged its ""aggression, expansionism and damaging of peace."" In fact, China and Russia only reaffirmed the internationally recognized one-China principle. China and Russia's position on the Taiwan question has been consistent for decades and has never manifested itself as the ""bullying"" Taiwan claims, but rather a statement of universally recognized facts. If this is ""bullying,"" countries without ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan, including the US, the UK, Germany, and France, are bullying the island as well. Taiwan's accusation is logically wrong in the first place. Meanwhile, it makes no sense to call the China-Russia joint statement the ""expansion of authoritarianism."" It is essentially the usual political rhetoric of the West, including the Taiwan island as its follower, to monopolize the definition of ""democracy."" The joint statement of China and Russia involves the common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom for all humanity. At the same time, both countries signed more than 15 agreements in various fields, which can be said to be beneficial to the peace and stability of the region and even the world.The meeting between Chinese and Russian leaders is aimed, first of all, at promoting the continued solid and long-lasting development of bilateral relations, regional and world peace and stability, as well as cooperation at the global strategic level, which is crucial to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, recovering the economy, and dealing with global issues such as climate change. The above-mentioned issues are also where the US has been hoping to work with China. So why should the cooperation between China and Russia be regarded as malicious? The smearing by Taiwan is simply a provocation and fault-finding for the purpose of increasing its own sense of existence. It also reflects the scruples of the West about China-Russia cooperation. It was in the best strategic interest of Western countries - with the Taiwan island not even qualified to be on the table - to turn China and Russia against each other and see cooperation with China dominated by the West. After this approach failed, the West tried to discredit China and Russia as ""authoritarian regimes that threaten democracy and peace."" Such rhetoric may have been bought by many in the past, but it is no longer marketable, especially with the growing infighting among parties within the US, the uncontrollable epidemic, and the US failure in Afghanistan. As the Chinese say, one has to look at himself in the mirror before criticizing others. As a pawn of the US, maybe Taiwan authorities should consider stopping the use of double standards and playing the victim since the lies no longer work.The author is an expert on China-US relations based in Shanghai. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251544.shtml,opinion/viewpoint
41,2022-02-06,US` extended solar tariffs 'distort` global new energy trade order: MOFCOM ,"Employees of an electric power company install photovoltaic panels on the roof of a factory in Daishan county, East China's Zhejiang Province, on January 4, 2022. The distributed solar power project, covering an area of 19,580 square meters, can provide 1.62 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, saving about 654.64 tons of standard coal and reducing 1,283.4 tons of carbon emissions. Photo: VCGChina's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) has slammed the US government for extending tariffs on imported solar products, saying such a move distorts the global trade order for new-energy products. In a statement, an official with the MOFCOM noted multiple restrictive measures imposed by the US on solar products over the past decade and called on the US to take concrete actions to jointly respond to climate change and promote global free trade.The statement came after the US government announced on Friday the extension of Section 201 tariffs on solar cells and modules for another four years. The tariffs had been set to expire on Sunday. The US' extension of Section 201 measures, despite strong opposition from stakeholders at home and abroad, will not help the sustainable development of the US solar industry, and also distorts the normal international trade order of the photovoltaic sector as a new-energy product, said the official from the MOFCOM's Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau.In January 2018, then US President Donald Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and modules. The initial tariffs stood at 30 percent, which would decline to 15 percent in the final year of the four-year period. Chinese experts said that the tariffs have done little to boost the US' solar product manufacturing sector in the past four years.Even with the added tariffs, Chinese solar products sold in the US are still much cheaper than those made in the US, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Sunday.Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie noted that solar modules used in US solar projects are 55 percent more expensive than those in European projects due to layers of tariffs. ""Trade protectionism is not going to end well. Development depends on competition,"" Lin said.The US' decision comes amid headwinds for the industry, including rising raw material costs and supply chain bottlenecks, and it would disturb the industry chain and global efforts to cope with climate change, Lin said.In the face of US trade protectionism, Chinese enterprises could turn to other emerging markets, including Africa and countries along the routes of the Belt and Road Initiative, Lin added.Photovoltaic products are important clean-energy products and are of great significance in achieving greenhouse emissions reduction targets.China is a global leader in photovoltaic product manufacturing. As of the end of 2021, China's installed solar power capacity was about 310 million kilowatts, up 20.9 percent year-on-year, according to the National Energy Administration.China will continue to work with other countries in the spirit of cooperation to promote low emissions and sustainable economic development, the MOFCOM official said.The official urged the US to take actions to jointly address climate change, promote global free trade, uphold the multilateral trading system, facilitate free trade in new-energy products, and contribute to global low carbon emissions and the common well-being of mankind.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251501.shtml,source/economy

49,2022-02-07,All eyes on the Beijing Winter Olympics witness a weakened US: Martin Jacques,"Members of Team China wave during the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics at the Beijing National Stadium on February 4, 2022 in Beijing, China. Photo: VCG2022 is not 2008. In 2008, the West was warming to China. It had growing expectations of their relationship. Since then, the warmth has been replaced by a cold chill. China did not westernize in the manner that the US expected and required. Worse, China got stronger as the US grew weaker. By 2016, the US was disillusioned that its hopes had not been fulfilled. It turned against China and sought to ostracize it. The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics take place in a very different atmosphere to the Summer Olympics in 2008. No doubt the US wishes it wasn't taking place at all. There is nothing it can do about that; so it resorted to a ""diplomatic boycott."" But this has been a damp squib. Who really cares whether or not US diplomats attend; sure, it is better if they are present, but if they aren't, the price of their absence is very small. It is a weak gesture made all the weaker by the fact that the boycott has remarkably few backers, 14 in total.The roll-call is as revealing as the pitifully small number. Only four members of the European Union have backed it (three others are not sending government representatives but that is because of COVID-19). Germany and France refused to join the boycott. New Zealand gave COVID-19 as their reason for not sending government representative, while Japan declined to send government officials but has sent Olympic officials. The US boycott is pretty close to being a non-event: without the Anglophone countries, it would be almost invisible. If the 2008 Summer Olympics marked China's dramatic arrival on the global stage, the 2022 Winter Olympics bear witness to the extraordinary decline of US influence over the 14-year period that separates the two events. If any further evidence of US decline is required in this context, take your mind back to the Moscow Summer Olympics in 1980 when, at the height of the Cold War, America staged a total boycott (athletes included) which amassed 66 countries.All of this is telling us something of much broader significance concerning the nature of the post-2017 world. Three things to be exact. First, the estrangement of the US and China will be long-lasting. Five years and still very much counting; not less than 10, more like 20, 30 years wouldn't surprise me. The growing schism is becoming more and more embedded in the global fabric. Second, the US decline is continuing apace, seems highly likely to continue and will probably accelerate. As the failed boycott illustrates, the US is floundering around, making it up as it goes along. Third, when this era comes to an end, as it eventually will, whenever that might be, there will be no return to the status quo ante or, if you like, 2016. The world will be very different. It will still be one world, but much more loosely so, dominated by two spheres, a Chinese one and an American one, with the former increasingly dominant. There is another reason why the 2022 Winter Olympics will be very different from the 2008 Summer Olympics. I am not thinking here of the pandemic, even though, of course, this has necessitated a fundamentally different kind of event. The fact is that the Winter Olympics are of a far more modest scale than the Summer Olympics: many less athletes, many less disciplines and rather less global appeal. The position of China is also interestingly different. It has much less experience of the Winter Olympics and there is much less of a tradition of involvement in the winter sports. China cannot be compared with the traditional North American and northern European giants of the Winter Olympics, such as the US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and Norway. Whereas for the great coming-out party in 2008, China could not only entertain the idea of winning more golds than any other country, but it actually achieved that goal. In 2022 this is impossible. But life - for countries as for individuals - is not always about coming top, it is much more about moving forward. China is intimately familiar with this. That has, after all, been China's story since 1978. In fact, it is rather remarkable that China put its hat in the ring to stage the 2022 Olympics, such was its rather intimidating starting point. Not only was China confronted with the challenge of creating, more or less from scratch, the necessary infrastructure for the Games, a task made even more difficult by the pandemic, but in typical Chinese ""never do things by halves"" style, it has seen the Olympics as an opportunity to transform remote mountainous regions of the country into winter sport resorts; 400 were built between 2014 and 2017, with a target of 800 this year. If the story of the 2008 Olympics was all about Beijing and its new modernity, the story of these Olympics is about China's urban-rural divide and the challenge of transforming some of the poorest and most remote areas of the country and providing them with a state-of-the-art transport infrastructure ensuring their connectivity with the rest of China.

Photo: Official website of the Casa Rosada Argentine President Alberto Fernandez laid a wreath at the mausoleum of the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong in Tiananmen Square on Saturday, the Casa Rosada, or the office of the President of Argentina, confirmed in its latest statement. Chinese experts on Monday said the two countries that are 20,000 kilometers apart have a deep historical friendship and a similar people-centered governing philosophy in a changing world.As part of Fernandez's schedule on the sidelines of the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, the visit to the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall came on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of China-Argentina diplomatic ties, which falls on February 19. In a previous interview with the Global Times, Argentina Ambassador to China Sabino Vaca Narvaja outlined reasons of arranging the visit to the memorial hall of Mao, a remarkable leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC). ""For both Argentina and the rest of the world, Mao is a very crucial state leader,"" said the ambassador, noting that President Fernandez is also president of Argentina's Partido Justicialista Party, which has ""very important historical ties"" with the CPC.He said former Argentine president Juan Peron even maintained friendship and correspondence with Chairman Mao. The friendship deepened during Fernandez's tour to Beijing. Fernandez met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday. In a major step, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation within the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.The two sides agreed to enhance trade cooperation, and promote financial support for the settlement of China's exports to Argentina. They also signed cooperation documents in the fields of green development, digital economy, aerospace, science and technology innovation, education and university cooperation. Fernandez's visit to the hall reminded the world that besides pragmatic cooperation, the historical ties and friendship between China and Argentina's ruling parties are also at a strategic significance, Zhou Zhiwei, an expert on Latin American studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday. Fernandez also visited the Museum of the CPC during his Beijing tour, speaking highly of the CPC ""for all it has done and the great achievements it has made for the Chinese people. ""The Partido Justicialista and the CPC share many ideas in their leadership, said Zhou. ""Argentina is highly supportive of the CPC's people-centered governance philosophy, and the similarities have a historical tradition,"" Zhou said.

Fernandez's visit to China and his recognition of the CPC's governing philosophy may have more profound connotations on the above issues, Zhou said. During Fernandez's meeting with Xi, China and Argentina reaffirmed their continued strong mutual support on issues involving each other's sovereign interests. Argentina said it will continue to adhere to the one-China principle on the Taiwan question and China will continue to support Argentina's demand for the full exercise of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251674.shtml,china/diplomacy

(Xinhua/Michael Tewelde)The African Union closed its annual summit Sunday by condemning a recent ""wave"" of military coups that has seen an unprecedented number of member states suspended from the bloc, spurring fears of what its top official described as democratic ""backpedaling. ""The putsches were among the main issues raised at the two-day summit, though leaders from across the continent also got bogged down in heated discussions over the AU's ties to Israel. Less than two weeks before the summit began Saturday, Burkina Faso became the fourth country to be suspended by the AU after disgruntled soldiers toppled president Roch Marc Christian Kabore. Guinea, Mali and Sudan are also currently suspended. ""Every African leader in the assembly has condemned unequivocally... the wave of unconstitutional changes of government,"" Bankole Adeoye, head of the AU's Peace and Security Council, told a press conference Sunday.But the AU has been accused of an inconsistent response, notably by not suspending Chad after a military council took over following the death of president Idriss Deby Itno on the battlefield in April 2021.And while Adeoye touted the AU's use of suspensions to punish coup leaders, analysts say the body must be more proactive to prevent putsches.Also on Sunday, leaders agreed to suspend debate on Faki's controversial decision to accept the accreditation of Israel, postponing a potentially divisive vote.Faki's move in July 2021 drew protest from influential members including South Africa and Algeria which argued that it flew in the face of AU statements supporting the Palestinian Territories. Both countries pushed to have the issue put on the summit agenda.During Saturday's session, Faki defended Israel's accreditation, noting that 44 member states have diplomatic ties with Israel.But Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Shtayyeh on Saturday called for Israel's accreditation to be revoked.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251647.shtml,world/africa

Athletes from China, the US and other countries are competing fairly at the Beijing Winter Olympics. They are the ones that should be in the spotlight, and the US politicians should have left the stage for them long ago, Chinese UN Ambassador said.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield had an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Saturday, where she made irresponsible and wrong remarks on the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, Xinjiang-related issues and the Taiwan question. When asked how she interpreted the fact that one of the two athletes that lit the torch was from China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Greenfield said that ""it is an effort by the Chinese to distract us from the real issue here at hand, that Uyghurs are being tortured. ""China's Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun refuted that Greenfield's groundless and politically-biased words have seriously poisoned the China-US relations. Facing such a smear campaign, China has no choice but to push back and clarify our position and reject the unfounded accusations by the US.Zhang stressed that the Beijing Winter Olympics has successfully kicked off. The opening ceremony was attended by around 170 official representatives from nearly 70 countries and international organizations, including 31 heads of state, heads of government, members of the royal family, and heads of international organizations. Many more state leaders and heads of international organizations have called or sent letters to President Xi Jinping to wish the Beijing Winter Olympics a great success and the Chinese people a happy Lunar New Year. This fully shows the international community's firm support for China, for the Beijing Winter Olympics, and for the Olympic Movement. The US attempt to make an issue of the Olympic Games has won no support and met with complete failure.Zhang stressed that in Team China, there are 20 athletes from 9 ethnic minorities, including Uygur and Tibetan. One of them is Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a Uygur cross-country skier who lit the Olympic caldron. She is the pride and excellent representative of the Chinese people. On what ground does the US has such inexplicable anger over this? And why? Zhang questioned.In her interview with the CNN, Greenfield also made irresponsible remarks concerned China's internal affairs. She not only compared the Taiwan question to the Ukraine border issue, but also said that ""[the US is] committed to protecting the security and supporting the security of the people of Taiwan while at the same time our policy has always been to recognize the One China policy. ""As a response, Zhang said that the future of the island of Taiwan lies in national reunification, not some security guarantee from the US. The US should stop emboldening and supporting the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, follow the true one-China policy, and match its actions with words. Otherwise, playing fire on the Taiwan question will only end up getting burned.Zhang pointed out that the US is facing serious political, economic, social, security and public health issues. Under such circumstances, the US politicians need to heed the voice of the people and solve its own problems, instead of being trapped in the mindset of American supremacy over everything, still less shifting responsibilities, creating confrontations or obstructing other countries' development, Zhang said. ""Here is my advice to the US: Do not go further down the wrong path. It will not only make your own people suffer, but also create more trouble for other countries and the whole world.""

Photo: cnsphotoChinese authorities released a guideline on Monday encouraging domestic steel mills to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to create world-class steel giants and accelerate the sector's high-quality development.By relying on the dominant enterprises in the industry, one or two pilot enterprises in the fields of stainless steel, special steel, seamless steel pipe and other special items are expected to be cultivated, according to an official guideline.M&As across different regions and ownership groups are encouraged to change the ""fragmented"" structure of the nation's iron and steel industry and enhance the endogenous power of enterprises.In addition, financial institutions are urged to provide comprehensive financial services to iron and steel enterprises pursuing M&As, structural adjustments, transformations and upgrading.To address concerns about a potential supply glut and reduce emissions in the heavily polluting industry, China is encouraging a realignment of the country's steel sector. From the beginning of the 14th Five-year Plan period (2021-25), China has been promoting green development to realize carbon neutrality by 2060.In 2021, China's crude steel output was 1.03 billion tons, down 3 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed in January. It was the first year-on-year decline since 2016.According to a plan released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, by 2025, China will build a number of super-sized steel conglomerates, and the top 10 steel enterprises will account for 60 percent of the country's steel output.In August last year, China's two major steelmakers - Ansteel and Ben Gang Group Corp - signed a deal to merge, creating the world's third-largest steelmaker. After the merger, Ansteel had an annual production capacity of 63 million tons of crude steel, ranking third in the world.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251612.shtml,source/economy
57,2022-02-07,China urges US to stop advancing bill `full of cold-war mentality`,"Zhao Lijian Photo: Ministry of Foreign AffairsChina's Foreign Ministry on Monday blasted the US House of Representatives' so-called America Competes Act, which is largely focused on China, saying that the bill's content regarding China is full of cold-war, zero-sum game mentality and slanders China's development path and domestic and foreign policies. ""The US should view China's development and China-US relations objectively and rationally, delete negative China-related content in the bill, stop deliberating and advancing it, and stop undermining China-US ties and cooperation in key areas,"" Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry told a regular press conference on Monday.The comments come as the US House of Representatives on Friday passed the bill, namely the America Competes Act, of which Democrats say will increase US semiconductor manufacturing and boost American competitiveness with China. The bill started as a bipartisan push to bolster US manufacturing and research, but it has been mired in long-standing partisanship concerning US policy on China. The bill has to pass both chambers before it can be sent to the White House for US President Joe Biden's signature.The 2,900-page legislation authorizes nearly $300 billion for research and development, including $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing and research into the key components used in automobiles and computers. It also allocates $45 billion over six years to ease supply-chain problems that have exacerbated shortages, Reuters reported. Observers and semiconductor industry insiders said that the bill is an indication that the US has gone deeper into its China containment obsession.The spokesperson said how the US develops and improvse its ""competitiveness"" is the US' own business, calling on Washington to stop making an issue out of China and use it as an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs and harm China's interests. The bill once again laid bare that the US' hegemony and bullying tactics is fundamentally contrary to the trend of the times and the aspirations of the global pursuit of peace, development and cooperation, and will only harm the US' own interests in the end, Zhao said.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251658.shtml,source/economy
58,2022-02-07,"China`s Caixin services PMI comes in at 51.4 in January, lowest in five months","A staff member presents a serving spoon at a Hunan cuisine restaurant in Yuelu District of Changsha, central China's Hunan Province, April 15, 2020. (Xinhua/Chen Zeguo)China's private Caixin Services Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI), which measures national services sector activity, came in at 51.4 in January 2022, lower than last month's 53.1 and also the lowest level in the past five months, Caixin released the data on Monday. The previously released Caixin China Manufacturing PMI fell 1.8 percentage points to 49.1 in January 2022, the lowest since March 2020. The simultaneous decline of the two major industries dragged down the Caixin China Composite PMI by 2.9 percentage points to 50.1 in January 2022, slightly above the marginal standard.The trend shown by Caixin's survey result was in line with that of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The NBS released manufacturing PMI in January 2022 which recorded a decline of 0.2 percentage points to 50.1, while the services PMI fell 1.7 percentage points to 50.3, driving the composite PMI down 1.2 percentage points to 51.0.Wang Zhe, a senior economist from Caixin, said that the plunge in domestic and overseas demand, continued intensive employment situation and high price of multiple raw material declined optimism on the service sector. Responding companies reported that relatively low market demand and insufficient replenishment of new job positions had resulted in an inactive labor market. Companies also reported that the epidemic control policies had some impact on production.Caixin's survey pointed out the high price for specific raw materials was the main reason that raised the companies' cost in service sector, which made input price index much higher than producer's price index in January 2022. Regional COVID-19 outbreaks in Xi'an of Northwest China's Shaanxi Province and Beijing during December 2021 and January 2022 constrained production, transportation, and marketing of industries across the country, according to the Caixin report. Wang noted that economic policies in 2022 should focus on addressing industry structure improvement, employment and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in order to confront market challenges.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251602.shtml,source/economy
59,2022-02-07,Chinese firms rush to support women`s football team after Asian Cup win,"Players of the Chinese women's national soccer team Photo: Courtesy of China Eastern AirlinesWhile the spotlight has been shining on the Chinese women's national football team following their latest victory of winning the AFC Women's Asian Cup, many Chinese companies have also rushed to support the team that has won nationwide praises. Chinese dairy behemoth Mengniu Dairy announced through its official Weibo account on Sunday that it has given a cash prize of 10 million yuan ($1.58 million) to the Chinese women's football team.Alipay also awarded a total of 13 million yuan to the team, with 10 million yuan for the players and 3 million yuan for the coaching team. The companies' moves, though most likely aimed at showing appreciation for the team's efforts that have inspired the entire country, also reflect the growing popularity of women's football and women's sports in general, which would also boost businesses in relevant sectors, analysts noted.Around 10 brands and companies have been sponsoring Chinese football teams, both women's and men's. But the only brands that have been sponsoring the Chinese women's team specifically are car trading platform Renrenche under Chinese life information provider 58 Group and Chinese social media start-up Xiaohongshu, or Little Red Book, since July 2021, right before the Tokyo Olympics, news portal yicai.com reported.Chen Jianning, vice president of 58 Group, told the Global Times on Monday that the Chinese women's football team is hard-working and never gives up, which matches Renrenche's enterprise culture, and the team may increase the popularity of the brand among Chinese consumers. Renrenche signed a cooperation contract with the Chinese women's football team in 2021. ""After the Chinese women's national football team won, Renrenche will continuously sponsor the team as well as Chinese teenagers' football training and other sports,"" said Chen. Xiaohongshu told the Global Times on Monday that it has been cooperating with the Chinese women's football team by inviting team members to join the platform and create content as the women's football team is a very high-quality sports IP. Industry insiders noted that the commercial potential of the Chinese women's football team as well as the great potential of women's sports will continue to boom. The unleashed commercial potential for women's sports will not just be limited to football or sports in general, Zhang Yi, CEO of consulting and research firm iiMedia Research Institute, told the Global Times on Monday, adding that it will extend to the entire sports industry such as equipment, apparel, training and service providers. Globally, according to a report released by Deloitte, TV rights and sponsorship deals for most existing women's sports are worth at most millions of dollars, but the majority of them are below this value, noting that women's sports revenues in 2021 were estimated at well under $1 billion, a fraction of the global value of all sports, which reached $471 billion in 2018.Deloitte's report also anticipated that women's sports will grow to be worth a great deal more than $1 billion, with women's sports to be further promoted and commercialized.

61,2022-02-07,Chinese sportswear brands` tech prowess on display at Beijing Winter Olympics,"On October 27, Beijing Winter Olympic Games organizing committee unveils the staff outfits designed by Anta Sports. Photo: Courtesy of Beijing Winter Games organizing committeeAfter Team China won their first gold medal at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games in the short-track speed skating mixed team relay on Saturday, their uniforms - and the technologies behind them - triggered widespread attention among the Chinese public, with many praising the rising technological capabilities of Chinese firms in making advanced sportswear that used to be dominated by foreign brands. The short track speed skating suit, developed by domestic firm Anta, has reached the lightest and most breathable level in the world, the company said. It employs drag reduction technology and Dyneema anti-cut technology to maximize the speed of athletes while ensuring their safety. Anta's windproof breathable tech, A-Cross DRI technology, air turbulence control and slip drag reduction technology adopted in ski suits, worn by rising star free skier Gu Ailing, are able to keep athletes sweat-free and warm, according the company.Gu's freestyle skiing suit is windproof and waterproof, and it is tailored to ensure that she can move smoothly and freely.Analysts said that such technologies are an embodiment of the nation's level of industrial manufacturing, material research and a slew of other related sectors. Considering the difficulty in manufacturing, the high-tech suits are some of the best examples of the advances and achievements of China's manufacturing and scientific research. ""The technologies have a wide range of applications, not only in clothing, but also in the medical sector, maritime activities, underwater vehicles, microfluid devices and pipeline transportation,"" an analyst in materials science based in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, told the Global Times on Monday.The material should be light and close-fitting, but also wear-resistant and resistant to cutting - prevent ice skate blade from injuring athletes, which brings the difficulty of manufacturing and research and development to a new level, said the analyst. ""Take the two most basic requirements - reducing resistance and preventing cutting - as examples. These two requirements can even be said to be completely contradictory, which stopped countless brands from developing. Finally Chinese brands broke the foreign monopoly,"" the analyst said.The speed skating suit developed by Anta has been constantly tested in wind tunnels, and its surface uses a special structure to deflect air to effectively reduce drag. Anta's pro-grade hard core protection Dyneema anti-cut tech has won the ISPO Global Design Award.Steel frame snowmobile shoes, Anta's first intelligent simulation design, can reduce wind resistance by 10 percent to help athletes speed up. This pair of shoes, compared with a pair from a top foreign brand, can help improve an athlete's performance by 0.054 seconds, according to Anta.Lenovo Group also provided self-developed electrocardiography, which can help athletes receive high-frequency sampling through non-inductive wearable devices and form a set of intelligent training solutions.Apart from Anta, domestic brand Li-Ning recently made its first foray into ski sports with the launch of its Li-Ning Snowboarding collection.Guosen Securities said it is optimistic that domestic brands can take the opportunity of the Beijing Winter Olympics to achieve brand influence and recognition. Advanced technologies for sport equipment have fueled Chinese brands to go global.According to AliExpress, overseas sales of Chinese ski products increased by more than 60 percent year-on-year during the Spring Festival holiday - from January 31 to Sunday - including a 15-fold increase in domestic ski helmets. On Tmall, sales of Chinese ski helmets increased by 174 percent year-on-year and those of ski trouser suits were up by more than 200 percent. Domestic ski brands such as Anta, Li-Ning, Vector and NANDN are all very popular and have seen their sales increasing significantly from last week, according to statistics sent to the Global Times from Tmall Global.In the past year, consumers in 100 countries and regions around the world bought Chinese snow equipment on AliExpress. Buyers of Chinese ski and skating products are located as far north as Iceland and as far south as Chile. With the impact of the Winter Olympics, the number of domestic ski product brands on AliExpress increased by nearly 50 percent in one year.The Beijing 2022 Games is expected to further drive the development of the ice and snow economy, as China plans to expand the scale of its ice and snow industry to 1 trillion yuan ($157.3 billion) by 2025. Local sports brands should actively seize the opportunity to create a multi-faceted layout, according to a report by Guosen Securities.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251657.shtml,source/economy

Investors are also upbeat over policy support in various areas, including consumption and investment, from policymakers to tackle downward economic pressure this year, while growing interest in Chinese stocks from foreign investors are also offering support for the market, analysts noted.On Monday, the Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.03 percent, the Shenzhen Component Index was up 0.96 percent, and the ChiNext Index closed 0.31 percent higher. Trading value on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets hit 823 billion yuan ($129 billion). A total of 3,448 stocks rallied and 109 hit the daily limit, with oil and gas shares, rare earth shares and coal shares being the top gainers.The rally comes as a positive market reaction to the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics, particularly after a series of close coordination agreements between China and Russia was signed during the games, which are expected to play an important role in consolidating bilateral economic and trade ties and ensuring energy supplies, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Monday.Stocks related to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games also surged. A gauge that includes shares relevant to the Games rose 1.54 percent during the trading day.Share prices of Cultural Investment Holdings and Beijing Yuanlong Yato Culture Dissemination Co, cultural products manufacturers for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, jumped by the daily limit, while engineering provider COFCO Engineering & Technology Co gained more than 5 percent.The rally comes after demand for Beijing Winter Olympics merchandise, in particular mascot Bing Dwen Dwen, skyrocketed due to its mass popularity.After the Beijing Winter Olympics kicked off, more than 1 million fans flooded onto the official Winter Olympic flagship store on Tmall, leaving many accessories for Bing Dwen Dwen out of stock.In the face of the sudden boom for Bing Dwen Dwen products, the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee said that it was actively coordinating with factories to increase supplies, CCTV reported.Apart from the Winter Games, expectations for favorable policies for various sectors, including energy and infrastructure, also lifted market sentiment. Shares of banks, petrochemical companies and infrastructure construction companies also joined the rally, with PetroChina Co gaining more than 9 percent.China's prudent and flexible monetary policy and proactive fiscal policy have created bullish sentiment in the A-share market, Bo Wenxi, chief economist at wealth management firm IPG China, told the Global Times on Monday.The continuation of the policy support and the decline of the negative impact cast by the COVID-19 on the Chinese economy are expected to further lift market sentiment for the whole year, Bo said.In contrast, the US stock market is facing several downward pressures, including interest rate hike expectations and the end of quantitative easing, analysts said. ""Due to these uncertainties, the US stock market may experience major turbulence and losses this year, and more international capital will choose the Chinese market as a safe haven,"" Dong said.It is expected that foreign investment entering the Chinese market will increase significantly this year through stock connections or the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program, as China's prudent and proactive regulatory policies and low inflationary pressure continue to boost confidence of foreign investors, Dong said.Foreign investors have been piling into China at the start of 2022, and they set a record-high daily average of $413 million in investment inflows into the Chinese market during the first three weeks of the year, Reuters reported. ""China's market size, effective containment of the pandemic and increasing expectations for policy support, as well as the strong resilience of China's industrial base, are all contributing factors to the market,"" Bo said.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251598.shtml,source/economy
63,2022-02-07,Defending the Amazon,"A farmer carries a chainsaw at a coca plantation after cutting down trees to plant coca in Guaviare department, Colombia on December 6, 2021. Photo: AFPUsing a machete, Norma Souza Matapi slices a pineapple from its roots and places it into a woven bag slung across her forehead as she tends a family food plot deep in Colombia's Amazon rain forest.Indigenous communities in this remote corner of southeastern Amazonas province have preserved largely pristine tracts of forest for millennia based on ancient belief systems and a culture interwoven with nature. ""Women take care of the seeds and guarantee that each family and the community has enough to eat, and that food for our dances and meetings is available,"" said Souza, surrounded by dense jungle in the small riverside community of Bella Vista.Based on age-old fallow farming techniques, Souza will cultivate this plot for five to seven years and then, using controlled slash-and-burn clearing, switch to a nearby patch, allowing soil to regenerate and trees to regrow. ""We give time for the earth to rest. We live off the forest and so we look after it, taking only what we need,"" she said, standing next to cassava crops, a medicinal herb garden, and tobacco and coca plants used in rituals. ""We've been living here for thousands of years and there's no destruction of the forest,"" said Souza, a member of the Matapi indigenous group.Indigenous people carry a map in their heads - and sometimes on paper as well - of how their land is divided up, with designated areas for hunting, fishing and farming.There are also areas that cannot be touched - both sacred sites and sections of land near small isolated indigenous groups that avoid contact with others. ""We have to first get permission from the shaman before we cut down any trees, and we can only cut down certain species,"" said Celestino Yucuna, the community's ""captain"" and Souza's husband.Nature guardiansSuch practices are why indigenous people - in Colombia's Amazon and in many other parts of the world - are regarded by academics, environmentalists and many officials as the best guardians of the forest.Almost half of the remaining intact forests in the Amazon Basin are in indigenous territories, according to the United Nations.A 2021 UN report found that in nearly every Latin American country, indigenous lands showed lower deforestation rates than other forest areas.With deforestation rates still rising across the Amazon, finding effective ways to preserve those remaining strongholds of the planet's largest tropical rainforest will be crucial to tackling both climate change risks and surging losses of nature.Trees absorb about a third of the planet-warming carbon dioxide produced worldwide through the burning of oil, gas and coal. They also help regulate rainfall, ensuring more stable moisture for crops and reliable supplies of food.Establishing and then maintaining indigenous land rights in the Amazon basin areas of Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia costs less than $6 per hectare a year, the UN researchers found.They estimated securing land rights to 100 million hectares of indigenous forests - an area almost twice the size of all Central America - would cost less than $600 million per year.Evidence of the benefits of indigenous stewardship of forests is now influencing funding priorities, with more money being spent to strengthen indigenous cultures and protect their rights and unique knowledge. 'Mental map'Several hours downriver from Bella Vista, along the Miriti-Parana River that winds through thick jungle foliage of cascading vines and soaring palm trees, lies the Puerto Guayabo community of about 35 families.Inside a maloka - a meeting place and traditional thatched communal dwelling - lives shaman Evelio Yucuna, who guides the community's relationship with nature.That includes performing rites to protect farmers from snake bites before granting them permission to burn small patches of land allocated for growing crops.His broad library of knowledge centers on a core belief that nature - including water and forests - have spirits and an owner, and that permission is needed from that owner to use anything.Shamans seek permission by performing healing rituals to connect with the spirits in the forest before trees are felled. ""Trees are treated like humans and are the source of life,"" he said, chewing on green powdered coca leaves and tobacco paste as part of the age-old mambe ritual used to start meetings and connect participants to nature. ""We are a product of nature, we were born from the earth. We live from and depend on nature,"" he said.As a spiritual leader, Evelio Yucuna is responsible for ensuring ancestral cultural practices and beliefs are preserved. ""I have a mental map that I need to transmit to future generations. I have to pass on theory and practice and what's sacred and what isn't. I am the memory of people,"" he said.Looming threatsIn communities up and down the Miriti-Parana River, such beliefs are taught to children in dilapidated wooden schools on stilts, built by Catholic missionaries who once banned native languages and dance and have since been kicked out.Indigenous teachers now instruct in both native languages and Spanish, and ensure children learn an ecological calendar, based on cycles of the moon, that helps produce two main harvests a year, allowing communities to be self-sufficient.Indigenous leaders warn their culture and ancestral lands face mounting pressures from gold miners and loggers, who have yet to encroach into this part of Colombia's Amazon but are moving nearer.Elsewhere in Colombia's tropical forest and across other parts of the Amazon, including Peru's Madre de Dios region, intermittent gold rushes and illegal mining have turned once-intact forests into dead landscapes of mining craters sunk amid sand dunes.In the indigenous worldview, nature is sacred and everything in the forest and its soils cannot be commercialized. Such indigenous views are being increasingly integrated into laws in countries from Bolivia to New Zealand granting ""rights of nature"" to rivers and ecosystems.Reuters",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251620.shtml,world/americas
64,2022-02-07,Does the US want to play with Asia-Pacific allies again?: Global Times editorial,"Illustration: Chen Xia/GT According to US media reports, US President Joe Biden is preparing to unveil his administration's first broad economic strategy for the Asia-Pacific region. It is called the ""Indo-Pacific Economic Framework."" The Biden administration has pinned high hopes on this framework, and expects to use it to fill in the gap in its absence in a comprehensive trade agreement in the region, making up for the shortcomings of the Indo-Pacific Strategy in the economic and trade field. However, the most important thing for Washington is to form a small economic and trade circle that excludes China, and fight against ""China's expanding influence in the region."" It must be said that the US is daydreaming. According to reports, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework focuses on building digital trade rules, reshaping regional supply chains, and establishing green technology standards to siege China in key sectors in the economic and trade field, and further reinforce Asia-Pacific countries' dependence on the US. This will ensure the US' dominant position in the global supply chain. Instead of saying that the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a new platform to serve the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, one might as well say that it is a new weapon to serve US geopolitical goals.To manipulate this ""new weapon,"" Washington has done a lot. Last year, senior Washington officials took turns to visit Asia-Pacific countries. They came to peddle the framework before it was officially formed. At a time when the Ukraine issue is on the verge of breaking out into a fight, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Australia from Monday, attend the fourth Quad Foreign Ministers Ministerial Meeting among the US, Australia, India and Japan, and then go to Fiji to meet with Pacific Island leaders. Washington acknowledged that the trip relates to ""the challenges that China poses."" People can thus anticipate that his trip will be an advertising campaign for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Driven by the zero-sum Cold War mentality, Washington regards the friendly cooperation and normal exchanges between China and other countries as a fire emergency. It is attempting to put out the fire in a hurry-scurry and uneasy manner. The Biden administration has come up with a big move, trying to cut the economic and trade exchanges between China and Asia-Pacific countries abruptly, and to build a wall from a crevice, to solve the problem once and for all. But the reality in the Asia-Pacific is chilly for the US. Today, when economic globalization is developing, it is unimaginable to build a wall to exclude the world's largest trading power. This goes against the true wishes of Asia-Pacific countries and does not conform to their vital interests. No matter how extravagantly Washington talks, the undertone of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is closed, exclusive, and America First-driven. It runs counter to multilateralism and free trade, and at best is like a Thanksgiving dinner without turkeys. The other players are nothing more than vassals in the US-dominated supply chain. Everyone is clear about this.On the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, the US has already played around with its allies once. The Obama administration vigorously pushed for negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but it was shelved by the US after other members had gone through legal procedures. Donald Trump walked out of it as soon as he took office, leaving US allies stunned. Japan wants to invite the US to rejoin, but the Biden administration started its own and came up with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. While the US is capricious on major issues, how can it be trusted by others? Unless the lackeys like to be played with.Washington's understanding of ""competition"" has long deviated from the original intention of ""progress."" The US seems to have done a lot of things in the name of ""competition"" in recent years, but the result is basically having messed things up while consuming resources. That's because it does not understand the path to development. Past experience has proven that no economy can achieve sustained growth amid isolation and exclusion. On New Year's Day this year, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into effect and all US allies in the region participated, which shows that win-win cooperation is the choice of the times.Against this backdrop, Washington still wants to use brute force to pull the wheel of the time backward, but it doesn't know that it will only make itself stumble in the end. We can conclude that even if the US finally puts up the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, it will eventually turn out to be another mirage the US creates for its allies.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251687.shtml,opinion/editorial

(Photo: Xinhua)Forest rangers and volunteers battled flames and strong winds on Sunday to stop a fierce fire raging across Kenya's Aberdare national park for nearly 24 hours.The blaze broke out on Saturday night, according to an official working for Kenya Wildlife Service, the government body in charge of national parks, who said the fire was ""moving very fast. """"It is on the grasses, it is spreading and very windy,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, explaining that he was not authorized to speak to media. ""We have mobilized the community and staff around and today they have really tried their best... it is only that they were overwhelmed. ""The park's name was etched in history when Britain's Elizabeth II, then a princess on a visit to Kenya, received news of her father's death while staying at the Treetops hotel, a remote game-watching lodge built high into a tree in the Aberdare forest.Rhino Ark, a conservation charity in Kenya, said on Twitter that it had deployed helicopters to conduct aerial surveys of the area to estimate the extent of damage to the forest cover.The Mount Kenya Trust, a body set up to conserve the country's forests, said Sunday that a team had ""headed up to help with the bush fires in the Aberdares. """"They will camp and hit the fires at first light,"" it said on Twitter.The park lies some 100 kilometers north of the capital Nairobi.Located in the Aberdare mountain range, the park is home to spectacular waterfalls and lush bamboo jungles as well as a variety of wildlife including leopards, elephants and critically endangered black rhinos.The Aberdares are the third highest mountain range in Kenya, reaching a summit of just over 4.000 meters.In recent days, concern has grown over a contentious proposal before parliament which could allow politicians to determine if public forest can be carved out and handed over to private interests.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251635.shtml,world/africa
68,2022-02-07,Huawei distributes 50b yuan dividends to staff shareholders: reports,"Huawei's launch event is held in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province on December 23, 2021. Photo: Shen Weiduo/Global TimesChinese telecom giant Huawei is distributing tens of billions of yuan in dividends to staff shareholders for 2021, with the pre-tax amount per share expected to be 1.58 yuan ($0.25), a move expected to further inspire morale as the company fights against irrational crackdown by the US' government.As of December 31, 2020, Huawei's outstanding shares stood at about 34.7575 billion, indicating the amount of dividends to be paid for 2021 will exceed 50 billion yuan, according to calculations by some media organizations.Considering that the Chinese tech giant is still in a rather difficult period amid the US crackdown, the dividend level - although down 15 percent from the previous year - proves the confidence of Huawei's management in the company's prospects, observers said.Huawei is not a publicly listed company. Instead, it adopts a unique model in which employees hold 100 percent of the shares. The firm has said several times that it is a 100-percent employee-owned private enterprise. The dividend payments are a vital part of employees' incomes, in addition to their salaries and bonuses. Jiang Xisheng, chief secretary of Huawei's board of directors, said that employee stock ownership helps maintain the independence of the company's decisions, noting that since Huawei's revenue comes from every employee, the staff will not allow any influence to harm their interests or the company's long-term development.However, the company's development is tied to employees' incomes, and if the company loses money, the value of the shares will also decrease, and the employees - as shareholders - have to bear the corresponding risk of impairment, Jiang said.A Huawei employee said in a post on the company's online community Xinsheng that he is satisfied with the pre-tax dividend since the company faced extreme suppression by some countries last year.The dividend also comes after a decline of Huawei's revenue in 2021. Huawei's annual revenue in 2021 was about 634 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 28.9 percent, which means revenue has returned to the level of 2017.A sharp decline in the mobile phone business revenue was one of the main reasons.Huawei's rotating chairman Guo Ping said in his New Year's speech that in the face of continued turbulence in the external environment and challenges such as the politicization of technology in the industry of information and communication technology, the company should stick to its current strategy.Huawei's new efforts to boost business include expanding its cloud services business in the Asia-Pacific region, helping domestic companies reduce their carbon footprints, providing more 5G base stations and core network equipment to major Chinese telecom operators, as well as setting up partnerships for its HarmonyOS mobile platform.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251660.shtml,source/economy

""At the end of the day, the Olympic Games are a sports event, and it is only right that the athletes, not politicians, are in the limelight,"" said Brglez, who is also the member of the leadership of Slovenian Social Democratic Party and former Speaker of the National Assembly of Slovenia. Brglez extended his good wishes to Slovenian athletes saying they have been training very hard to participate in the Olympic Games and hoping ""their hard work will be rewarded with excellent results and medals."" According to the Slovenian Olympic Committee, 41 Slovenian athletes are competing in the ongoing Beijing Olympic Winter Games. The list comprises 12 Alpine skiers, 9 ski jumpers, 8 cross country skiers, 6 biathletes, 5 snowboarders and one athlete in Nordic combination. On Feb 5, the country's Ursa Bogataj won Olympic gold in women's ski jumping.Brglez also criticized Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa's recent public announcement on television that Slovenia and the Taiwan island ""are working on establishing [an] exchange [of] representatives."" In an interview with Indian TV station Doordarshan last month, Jansa falsely referred to Taiwan as a ""democratic country"" and called Beijing's response to Lithuania's provocations ""terrifying"" and ""ridiculous,"" arousing speculation that Slovenia will follow Lithuania's lead and challenge China's bottom line on the Taiwan question. Brglez criticized the remarks of JanÅ¡a in the TV broadcast saying, ""since he publicly expressed views that are his personal, without consultation with other foreign policy actors, above all the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia, and that do not represent the position of the Republic of Slovenia."" ""As reiterated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the recent conclusions of the National Assembly Foreign Policy Committee, Slovenia is not diverging from its position on the one-China policy,"" Brglez emphasized.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251639.shtml,opinion/viewpoint
70,2022-02-07,"Leaked F-35C crash video highlights US military's excessive troop deployment, loose management","Photo:WebAfter the US Navy confirmed the authenticity of a video and photograph of the crash of an F-35C stealth fighter jet on a US aircraft carrier in the South China Sea at the end of last month, another video online that appears to give a clearer and more detailed look of the mishap shows the aircraft slamming on the carrier's flight deck and being wrapped in fire before skidding into the sea.The accident seems terrible, as the aircraft would be beyond repair even if it did not fall into the ocean, and again exposed the exhaustion and lack of proper management of the US military under its excessive troop deployment in attempts to contain China, analysts said on Monday.Emerging online around Sunday, the video seems to be taken by a smart phone, as it shows a computer monitor playing an alleged record footage of the closed-circuit camera system aboard the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier on January 24, the day the accident took place.The first part of the video seems to be a recording of the aircraft carrier's Pilot's Landing Aid Television, which gives a look at aircraft as they land. It shows the F-35C approaching the carrier but significantly deviating from its landing course. Despite the landing signal officer's calls to add power and wave off, the F-35C slammed on the flight deck of the carrier, breaking its landing gear, as the aircraft began to skid on the deck with its belly while making a 180-degree turn as it moved forward.Taken from probably the carrier's flight control island, the second part of the video shows that the impact was a very heavy one, and the F-35C was immediately engulfed by a fireball. The aircraft soon slid into the sea from the left side flight deck, sparing many more aircraft parked on the right side.A previous statement by the US Navy said the pilot safely ejected, and a total of seven sailors were injured.The authenticity of the latest leaked video has not yet been confirmed by the US Navy, but it seems consistent with all previous confirmed information including official statements and images.The situation depicted by the video, including the wrong landing position, the breaking of the landing gear and the crashing on the flight deck was accurately pictured by analysts reached by the Global Times previously.After watching the new video, analysts said that the accident was one of the worst-case scenarios. ""First, the aircraft slammed on the flight deck. Second, it caught fire, possibly because its fuel tank took a hit and was ignited by sparks caused by the friction,"" an expert told the Global Times on Monday, requesting anonymity.Even if the F-35C did not fall into the ocean, it would be hard to repair when it had experienced such a terrible accident, said the expert, noting that the video also suggested the cause of the accident is more likely human error, as the pilot's approach on the carrier was wrong.But the US will still do whatever it can to try to recover its most advanced carrier-based fighter, because it not only contains the latest technologies, but possibly also highly confidential intelligence like communications channels, analysts said.This again reflected the US military's excessive troop deployment near China has taken its toll, as its personnel are making avoidable mistakes probably due to exhaustion, experts said, noting that the repeated leaks of videos and images also exposed the loose management of the US military.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251665.shtml,china/military

""""Clearly, we are outnumbered and we are losing this battle,"" he told CFRA radio. ""This has to be reversed; we have to get our city back,"" Watson said.Watson called the truckers ""insensitive,"" as they have continued ""blaring horns and sirens and fireworks, and turning it into a party.

The next time he saw them they said they had found twice as much and took it upon themselves to help clean some of it up. ""Throwing plastic into the sea is criminal,"" he said.

""Asked to elaborate on his taste in music, Francis, who made a surprise visit to a Rome record store in January, said he mostly likes classical music but also tango.Asked if he had danced the tango as a young man in his native Argentina, Francis, 85, said ""a porteno who does not dance the tango is not a porteno."" Porteno is the Spanish name for a resident of Buenos Aires, his home city.In response to a question about war, Francis said: ""Think about it.

Yang was latest and the first official to be probed in the Year of the Tiger.Yang was once the director and Party secretary of Kunming's central branch of the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, and he also served in the post of the director of the Yunnan provincial branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).He was elevated to the bureau-director level in 2009, according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI).Yang was transferred to Nanning, capital of South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as the director of the local PBC branch and the director of the Guangxi regional branch of the SAFE. He returned to Yunnan in 2013.China has been ramping up efforts in recent years to maintain a strong and persistent crackdown on corruption.In the financial sector, at least 24 officials have been probed or penalized since October 12, 2021 when China launched a national anti-corruption inspection focused on financial institutions and regulators, according to a Bloomberg News tally based on announcements from the CCDI.In a work conference held at the end of last year, the PBC vowed to resolutely strengthen supervision of financial institutions and its crackdown on corruption.It is necessary to unswervingly fight against financial corruption and strengthen the daily supervision of top leaders and leading groups at all levels, it stressed.Efforts will be stepped up to investigate and punish any corruption behind the runaway expansion of capital and the monopoly of platform enterprises, in order to sever the connections between power and capital, and financial discipline will be strengthened, according to a communiquÃ© released by the CCDI in January.Routine supervision and special inspections should both be strengthened, and the issue regarding ""the latter part of the story"" of addressing problems discovered during the inspections into central-level financial institutions should be taken seriously, it said. ""From the perspective of financial supervision, the anti-corruption efforts are obviously picking up. This is related to the rapid development of the financial industry over recent years,"" said Dong Ximiao, chief researcher of Shenzhen-based Zhaolian Finance.Due to the rapid development of the sector and more approval items, there are more opportunities for power seeking, according to Dong.In addition, it is worth noting that these problems also occurred in the context of strong supervision, when the power of the supervisory authorities was even greater.Global Times",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251603.shtml,source/economy

The two sides are expected to discuss Swiss-Norwegian bilateral relations, human security, peace promotion, and humanitarian policy. Photo: AFPSwiss President Ignazio Cassis called Sunday for ""calm and creativity"" to fix Switzerland's thorny relations with the European Union.Ties between Brussels and Bern have been strained since non-EU member Switzerland suddenly decided in May 2021 to end years of discussion toward a broad cooperation agreement with the bloc.Cassis said that in sorting out Bern's future relationship with Brussels, Switzerland must get away from ""purely technical and institutional questions"" and instead focus on matters of content. ""It is only when we have enriched the content, when politics and society recognize the material gains that Switzerland can expect, that an institutional rapprochement will be accepted,"" he told the SonntagsZeitung newspaper.The situation needs ""a little calm and creativity,"" he added.Landlocked Switzerland is surrounded by the EU, which is its main economic partner.The years of talks on a framework agreement hit an impasse after the EU refused to budge on Swiss demands to exclude key issues relating to state aid, wage protections and freedom of movement. EU-Swiss ties are currently governed by a patchwork of agreements, and for more than a decade discussions were ongoing toward an overarching accord that would have harmonized the legal framework governing the relationship. The agreement would also have established a dispute settlement mechanism. But Switzerland is reluctant to meet EU demands for budget contributions and alignment on European rules as the price to keep free access to the vast EU market. Cassis said Switzerland should not simply be looking at the EU's internal market but also cooperation in fields such as health, research and culture.He said the Swiss government was setting out the framework for a possible package of agreements with Brussels, or at least an agenda for talks.Cassis said both sides had an interest in regularizing their relations. Switzerland is the EU's fourth-largest trading partner and 1.4 million EU citizens live in the country of 8.6 million people.

Photo: XinhuaThe US government will protect American athletes participating in the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and their freedom of speech, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN on Sunday. She also repeated the US' lies over China's Xinjiang in the CNN program ""State of the Union."" The US has undertaken a political fiasco with its efforts to politicize the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, leaving itself isolated in this regard. Athletes from China, the US and other countries and regions are competing fairly at the Games. The athletes are the protagonists but some US politicians don't want to yield the spotlight - Thomas-Greenfield's remarks are just a malicious provocation with such a mentality. Her irresponsible and erroneous statements on topics including the Beijing 2022 and Xinjiang are completely groundless and politically biased. China's Ambassador to the United Nations Zhang Jun rebutted Thomas-Greenfield's unfounded accusations against China. Zhang said that the repeated lies by the US about the ""genocide"" in Xinjiang have already been debunked by facts. In Team China, there are 20 athletes from nine ethnic minorities, including Uygur and Tibetan. Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a Uygur cross-country skier who lit the Olympic cauldron, is the pride and an excellent representative of the Chinese people. Zhang asked, ""On what grounds does the US have such inexplicable anger over this? And why? ""Thomas-Greenfield has always been engaged in an ideological campaign and political correctness while ignoring the facts, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. ""Her words show that some American political elites have overestimated the US' rumor-mongering capacity and underestimated the ability of people and media in much of the world to discern right from wrong,"" Li said. Years ago, some US athletes might have already been affected by American politicians' false narrative to create accusations out of thin air.Representing Team USA six years ago at Rio 2016 Olympic Games, Ryan Lochte, a 12-time Olympic medalist, gave rise to a diplomatic situation that became dubbed Lochtegate. He and three teammates claimed to be robbed at gunpoint and later charged with falsely reporting a crime as his tall tale was exposed. The four were once barred from leaving Brazil.Thomas-Greenfield has apparently forgotten this embarrassment to Team USA. She brazenly clamored to ""protect"" American athletes. A US State Department official previously told CNN that the department ""has about two dozen diplomatic security agents in Beijing to provide protections for the US athletes. ""Nevertheless, though, why should normal athletes worry about their safety? Is there a serious COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing? Is China plagued by gun violence? No. On the contrary, what should US athletes be concerned about is how to avoid being manipulated by American politicians and turned into sacrificial lambs of US politics. Li believes those so-called diplomatic security agents are actually monitoring American athletes. ""What can two dozen agents protect? Not to mention that China is a much safer place than the US. It is a typical American-style disgusting political operation to sell the impression that China is unsafe,"" Li noted. Shortly before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Games, the FBI warned athletes against the use of personal mobile phones in China. However, athletes from across the world shared with fans their happiness through mobile phones during the opening ceremony, and many athletes have also been posting their comfort and amazing stay in the Olympic Village on their social media accounts. From this perspective, maybe what US political elites worry about is not alleged ""malware, data theft and installation of 'tracking tools' on mobile devices"" as in a BBC report, but the scenario where people around the world will know through the athletes' cameras what China is really like. They don't want people to realize the fact that their portrayal of China is all lies trying to mislead the public. ""The US' long-term smear campaign has made some Americans feel it is unsafe to be in China. But if they really visit China and spend some time here, they can see how despicable the lies their government makes up about China are,"" Li said. Thomas-Greenfield's sabotaging and discrediting of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games damage the interests of athletes from all over the world, including American athletes, and the Olympic Movement. It runs counter to the Olympic spirit and the mainstream public opinion of the international community. It is hoped the US government stops instigating the athletes and lets them enjoy this major sports gathering that comes every four years.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251677.shtml,opinion/viewpoint
77,2022-02-07,Truss` Malvinas remarks demonstrate mindset of `aristocrats in decline`,"British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss Photo: AFPThe Malvinas Islands ""are part of the British family,"" and China ""must respect"" the Malvinas Islands' ""sovereignty,"" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted on Monday. Such rhetoric came after China and Argentina on Sunday issued a joint statement in which China reaffirmed its support for Argentina's demand for the full exercise of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and its support for an early resumption of negotiations in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.The UK is enchanted by the dream of becoming a ""Global Britain,"" still seeing itself as a major global power, but that is actually not the case. Some UK political elites are stuck in the mindset of declining aristocrats. The UK has fallen into strategic anxiety, worrying it will lose its current international position and influence because of its increasingly declining capability. Against this backdrop, many British political elites are eager to prove themselves, for example, by arguing that Brexit is the right decision, or by demonstrating they still play a role in global affairs and are capable of defending their interests. Ironically, when London urged Beijing to ""respect"" the ""sovereignty"" of the Malvinas Islands, it had already repeatedly attempted to interfere in the South China Sea situation. It has meddled with China's internal affairs, like those on Hong Kong, ultimately contradicting itself. This is typical practice for Western countries. Some experts label the move as a double standard but I would like to say they have always exploited one standard. They believe they have the moral high ground, and whatever they do is positive and moral, while moves by other countries, especially rivals like China, are negative and immoral.The Johnson government proposed the ""Global Britain"" strategy, hoping that Britain retain a place in the global landscape. The UK's national strength does not fulfill this strategy. This explains why London has repeatedly followed suit behind Washington's, especially when it comes to China policy.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is encountering a trust crisis. The failure to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus epidemic and the ""Partygate"" scandal caused Johnson's approval ratings to drop significantly. Recently, baseless criticism and slandering of China may aim to divert domestic attention. For example, the UK followed the US' lead in its diplomatic ""boycotting"" of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Truss' own comments are ludicrous. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, she said China could possibly launch its own war of aggression in the Indo-Pacific and that it could be inspired to do so if Russia was to invade Ukraine.Their anxiety comes as they become aware that they cannot contain China's rise. They can only groundlessly slander China, in an attempt to persuade the public to believe they are better than China, so as to maintain support for their government. They are lost in an imaginary world where they can shape China as they like. This is an embodiment of the arrogance of the West toward China. However, facts speak louder than words, and truth about China is not something that Western government can fabricate.

Photo: VCGChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that choosing a Uygur athlete to be a torchbearer at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony reflects that China's policy of promoting winter sports and improving people's health is benefiting people of all ethnic groups, and that China is a big family of ethnic groups.Zhao made the comment when asked what China's motive is in choosing an ethnic-Uygur torchbearer. Zhao said the genocide rumor is the biggest lie of the century, and the remarks made by some US politicians are nothing less than lying through their teeth. According to the Olympic Charter, Dinigeer Yilamujiang, the Uygur athlete, has the right to participate in the games and ceremonies as a member of Team China, Zhao stressed. Second, there are clear criteria for selecting torchbearers for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, which require comprehensive consideration of personal will, competition results, age, popularity, ethnic composition and other factors, so as to fully reflect broad representation. The torch of the Beijing 2020 Winter Olympic Games passed through three generations of Chinese athletes at the opening ceremony, representing the continuation and inheritance of the Olympic spirit. We are glad to see that athletes from all ethnic groups, including Yilamujiang, have joined the Chinese sports team for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Zhao said.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield had an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Saturday where she made irresponsible and wrong remarks about the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Xinjiang-related issues.

79,2022-02-07,What’s happening in the Ukraine-Russia crisis," Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen to their highest level in years, as Washington and its European allies try to deter a potential invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces massed at the border. The Russian view: Kremlin officials have focused on the 2015 Minsk peace deal, which was designed to end a conflict between Kyiv and Moscow-backed separatists in the contested Donbas region of eastern Ukraine after the Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. The Kremlin has accused Ukrainian officials of not fulfilling their side of the agreement. Moscow also has sought assurances that Ukraine, a former Soviet state, will never be allowed to join NATO. In a Dec. 17 ultimatum presented to the United States, Russia said it wanted commitments that NATO would withdraw troops from countries that joined the military alliance after 1997. Putin said last week that Russia was opposed to any eastward NATO expansion “because it poses a common threat to us.” The Ukrainian view: Officials in Kyiv have criticized the Minsk deal, which was brokered after a string of military losses. Still, officials say they are open to talks — provided they take place in a third country not allied with Russia. (The 2015 agreement was negotiated in Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, is an ally of Putin’s.) Some Ukrainian diplomats have suggested they could be willing to make concessions to avoid war. On Monday, officials ruled out withdrawing Ukraine’s application to join NATO. In the meantime, more Ukrainians are starting to pack emergency bags, plan escape routes and learn basic survival and self-defense skills. The Western view: The United States and other allies have said they support the 2015 Minsk deal but have called on all parties to live up to their parts of the bargain. The Biden administration has rejected Russia’s demands on NATO and instead called for Moscow to pull its forces back from the Ukrainian border and to stop supporting separatists in Donbas. A grim U.S. assessment reported this month concludes that Russia soon may complete preparations for what appears to be a large-scale invasion. The review predicted that a war could cause Ukraine’s government to collapse within two days, kill or wound up to 50,000 civilians and displace up to 5 million people. Russian troops: Moscow began moving troops to regions bordering Ukraine last year. Biden says more than 150,000 Russian troops are at the borders and in Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014. Russian military drills with Belarus, which also borders Ukraine, began last week. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, said Russian forces massed in Belarus would depart later this month. Western officials fear the 10 days of joint military exercises could become a cover for Moscow to invade Ukraine. Also, six Russian warships have reached Crimea and docked in a strategic port on the Black Sea. Kyiv is holding its own tit-for-tat drills, making use of weapons supplied by NATO. The Biden administration said it believes Russia is planning to invade, possibly after Moscow creates a pretext by broadcasting staged images of civilian casualties to drum up anger against Kyiv. The most recent U.S. assessment concluded that Russia has massed most of the combat forces it would need to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and attack Kyiv. If executed, the assault probably would be the largest land offensive in Europe since World War II. NATO forces: The United States has responded by sending more troops to Eastern Europe, with about 3,000 U.S. personnel moving to NATO’s eastern flanks in Romania and Poland from their posts in Germany and Fort Bragg, N.C. U.S. officials said Friday that the Biden administration would deploy an additional 3,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to Poland. NATO allies also have repositioned military hardware, with Denmark and Belgium sending F-15 and F-16 fighter jets to the Baltics last month. Britain has offered to send jets, warships and military specialists, as well. NATO allies have said that they would not send troops to Ukraine in the event of an invasion. Ukraine is not a NATO member and, therefore, is not covered by the alliance’s collective-defense clause. Washington and London said Saturday that they would pull military personnel on training missions in Ukraine. What about Ukraine? Ukraine’s political leadership has largely downplayed the risk of conflict, with Zelensky telling Ukrainians to “take a breath” and “calm down.” But he also signed into law in February plans to strengthen the country’s armed forces, bringing them from 250,000 active troops up to about 361,000. That is equal to only about a third or so of Russia’s 900,000-strong armed forces. Earlier this month, a former defense minister of Ukraine, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, called the situation “pretty dire.” He assessed that Russia had massed enough troops to occupy Kyiv or another city but not enough to seize the entire country. Concern from Kyiv appeared to mount, and Ukraine hosted a military exercise of its own while officials condemned the Russian operations as a threat to Ukrainian sovereignty. All sides say that they are willing to talk. Scholz, the German chancellor, sat down with Zelensky and Putin this week. Ahead of his trip to Moscow, Scholz said he would underscore to Putin that any attack on Ukraine would have “serious political, economic and geostrategic consequences.” Scholz’s meetings came after a diplomatic push by French President Emmanuel Macron, who appeared determined to strike a mediating tone. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has offered to mediate talks between Ukraine and Russia. His offer was greeted warmly by Zelensky, who was hosting the Turkish leader in Kyiv. Turkey is a member of NATO but has maintained relations with Russia — even, controversially, buying Russian-made missile defense systems. One potential U.S. concession: Officials confirmed recently that they offered to let Russia inspect missile defense systems in Romania and Poland to verify that there are no Tomahawk cruise missiles there. In return, the United States would seek inspections of similar sites in Russia. The United States has long maintained that no Tomahawk missiles are deployed in Europe, despite Russian claims. Sanctions? Western nations have warned of retaliatory sanctions against Russia if aggression continues, potentially targeting even Putin himself. The Biden administration has discussed everything from blocking Russia’s access to electronic supplies made with U.S. technology to cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT banking system, which handles the flow of money worldwide. Energy? Russia is a major supplier of natural gas to Europe, raising significant questions about what would happen if a conflict led Moscow to cut off the supply. At the heart of the debate is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major infrastructure project that, if completed, would transport natural gas from Siberia to Germany. The United States views the pipeline as a geostrategic threat. At a news conference with the German chancellor this month, Biden said that “there will no longer be Nord Stream 2” if Russia invades Ukraine.

""The auctions that take place in France are immoral, it is very regrettable that the French government has not legislated on this,"" Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in Mexico City.On January 28, auction house Millon sold about 30 pre-Hispanic Mexican artifacts despite calls from Mexico's culture ministry to refrain from doing so.Lopez Obrador said his wife, historian Beatriz Gutierrez, had sent a letter to the French Foreign Ministry, urging it ""to intervene in these auctions of pre-Hispanic art"" taken ""illegally"" from Mexico.He added the sale of cultural heritage items should be discontinued worldwide, and urged would-be buyers: ""Don't become accomplices of criminals, don't act like criminals. ""Lopez Obrador also criticized Austria for holding on to a centuries-old Aztec feather crown believd to have belonged to Emperor Moctezuma (1502-20) despite repeated calls for its repatriation.In recent years, Mexico has been trying to recover artifacts in the hands of private collectors around the world, with only partial success.To date, it has managed to recover some 6,000 artifacts taken from the country, according to Lopez Obrador.As well as calling for artworks to be returned, Mexico has accused major European fashion houses of cultural appropriation for lifting native designs for their clothes.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251732.shtml,world/europe

82,2022-02-08,Australia's hasty nuclear submarine plan to be outpaced by China's development: experts,"The Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Tennessee returns to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia, US. File Photo: XinhuaIn an attempt to contain China, Australian Defense Minister recently said that Australia could get the first nuclear submarine under the framework of AUKUS before 2038. However, Chinese military experts said on Tuesday that this delivery schedule is too hasty and China's rapid development during this period will outpace the Australian one.Australian Defense Minister, Peter Dutton, recently said that he was extremely confident that Australia would have its first nuclear-powered submarine before 2038, adding that recent discussions with the US and UK officials under the AUKUS agreement had reassured him that the submarines would be built years earlier than many defense experts expected, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Monday.One of the key projects of AUKUS, a new alliance by Australia, the UK and the US announced in September 2021, is to equip Australia with nuclear submarines in an attempt to contain China.When the AUKUS agreement was announced, an 18-month process was launched by all members to figure out the best way to deliver Australia nuclear submarines, according to the report by the Sydney Morning Herald. ""From a technological perspective, it is possible that Australia could get its first nuclear submarine by 2038 since the US and the UK are indeed capable of building this kind of submarine,"" Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the Naval Research Academy of the People's Liberation Army, told the Global Times on Tuesday.However, the question remains on exactly what kind of nuclear submarine Australia will get.If, for example, the US is willing to sell its off-the-rack Virginia-class submarine or transfer its technology and production lines to Australia, then, 2038 is possible. But, if the three countries are thinking about a customized or a completely new submarine, which is more likely in this case due to the high sensitivity of this kind of military hardware, it will likely take longer, analysts said. ""2038 sounds hasty to design and build a new nuclear submarine for a country with no experience, even with technology transfer,"" a Chinese military expert who requested to remain anonymous told the Global Times on Tuesday.Australia is not a nuclear power and the plan by the US and the UK to grant Australia nuclear-powered submarines increases the risks of nuclear proliferation and an arms race, experts said. ""From a political point of view, the three countries would also have to face the pressure from the international community to meet that schedule,"" Zhang said, adding that ""even if Australia does get the nuclear submarine, it will not be such a big threat to China, since war cannot be won with just one or two types of weapons. """"China's national defense development has been on a fast track and is expected to continue advancing. By 2038, China will likely have sufficient means to safeguard its security interests from Australia's nuclear submarine,"" the anonymous source told the Global Times.Dutton also said that Australia and its allies will ""lose the next decade"" unless they stand up to China in the South China Sea, as the US and others ""acquiesced and allowed the militarization to the point where China has 20 points of presence in the South China Sea.China did not militarize the South China Sea, as all Chinese presence in the region serves only to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the expert said, noting that countries from outside of the region like the US, which have been sending warships and warplanes, are the real ones responsible for the militarization in the South China Sea.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251779.shtml,china/military
83,2022-02-08,Bank CEO sentenced for steering $16 million in loans with hopes of getting a cushy Trump administration job," A Chicago banker will spend one year and one day in prison for approving $16 million worth of illegal loans to Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, in the hope of securing a cushy job in the Trump administration, a federal judge ruled Monday. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced Monday that Stephen Calk, chairman and chief executive of the Federal Savings Bank, headquartered in Chicago, had corruptly used his position to issue high-risk loans to Manafort to buy his way into the campaign and then the Trump administration. “Stephen Calk abused his position as the CEO of a federally-insured bank to try to buy himself prestige and power by trading millions of dollars in high-risk loans for influence with a presidential campaign and consideration for positions at the highest levels of the Defense Department,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. “Today’s sentence sends the message that those who corrupt federally regulated financial institutions will be held to account,” he added. The sentence comes after a jury in New York found the banker guilty of financial institution bribery and conspiracy to commit financial bribery in July. After the conviction, Audrey Strauss, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement that Calk “used the federally-insured bank he ran as his personal piggy bank to try and buy himself prestige and power.” During the three-week trial, evidence revealed that the financier approved $16 million in exchange for Manafort’s help in obtaining a high-level position in the Trump administration. Manafort, a lobbyist and political consultant known for leading a lavish lifestyle, headed Trump’s presidential campaign from March to August 2016. When Trump was elected president in November 2016, Manafort remained close to the campaign and “provided informal input to the presidential transition team,” according to prosecutors. Between July 2016 and January 2017, according to prosecutors, Manafort sought millions of dollars from the Federal Savings Bank. Calk knew Manafort “urgently needed” the money to avoid foreclosure on multiple properties, and leveraged his position as head of the bank to ask him for help in getting a coveted position with the administration, prosecutors added. While the loans were pending approval, Calk sent Manafort a list of his desired jobs in the Trump administration. At the top was secretary of the treasury, secretary of commerce and secretary of defense. But he also expressed interest in a ranked list of 19 ambassadorships, starting with the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, the attorney general’s office said. In the weeks after Trump’s victory — after Manafort’s first loan for $9.5 million had been issued, and while a second set of loans were pending — Manafort’s efforts and influence in the administration came through, according to prosecutors, and Calk was formally interviewed for the position of undersecretary of the Army in 2017. He was not hired. It could not be determined Tuesday who represented Calk in court. According to the New York Daily News, Calk is appealing his conviction and has admitted to being “deeply humbled.” “As you can imagine, my life is in shambles,” he said during the sentencing. “I deeply, deeply regret that the bank’s reputation has been tarnished as a result of my indictment and my conviction.” To cover up for his crimes, prosecutors said Calk made false statements to the comptroller of the currency regarding the loans to Manafort, including statements that he had never wanted a position in the Trump administration. Calk approved the loans, despite “significant red flags” regarding Manafort’s ability to repay them, given a history of defaulting on prior loans, prosecutors said. On top of the prison time, Calk was sentenced to 800 hours of community service and was also ordered to pay more than $1 million in fines. Manafort was identified as a co-conspirator in the case against Calk, but he was not charged. His lawyer, Kevin Downing, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He was, however, tried and convicted in 2018 for tax and bank fraud in a case brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Manafort was sentenced to 7½ years in prison, but Trump pardoned him before leaving office in 2020. ",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3HJMOsY,politics

""The deal we reached will strengthen America's steel industry and ensure its workforce stays competitive, while also providing more access to cheaper steel and addressing a major irritant between the United States and Japan, one of our most important allies,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement.US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the deal would ""protect a vital American industry, our workers and their families."" However, the deal does not resolve all the outstanding trade issues between the two countries.Levies of 10 percent on Japan's aluminum exports will remain for now, while the new tariff system covers less than the 1.8 million tons of steel the US imported from Japan in 2017, the last year before the levies were imposed, according to Commerce Department data.Japan ""regrets"" that the US ""has taken no steps to address"" tariffs on aluminum, Japan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Tuesday.He said Japan sees the announcement about eased levies on steel as a ""step forward,"" however, adding the country will ""continue to push the US for complete resolution"" of the matter.The Alliance for American Manufacturing welcomed the agreement, particularly a provision ensuring imported steel must be ""melted and poured"" in Japan so that other nations don't transship their metals through the country.The trade group's president Scott Paul said Biden's move widened ""the focus on global overcapacity, while maintaining appropriate tools to mitigate threats to our economic and national security. ""Trump's Republican administration engaged in a number of trade spats with allies and adversaries alike, many of which were unresolved when Biden took office in January 2021.Among those were the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from several countries, including the European Union and Japan.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251725.shtml,world/americas
87,2022-02-08,Biden’s pick to lead military in Middle East says U.S. has a ‘moral obligation’ to help Afghans left behind," President Biden’s nominee to command U.S. troops across the Middle East said on Tuesday that he sees Iran’s regional influence and weapons programs as “vexing,” and that he believes America has a “moral obligation” to evacuate more Afghans who helped the United States during its longest war. Army Lt. Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, who has deployed to the Middle East and Afghanistan throughout his career, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that if confirmed as the next commanding general of U.S. Central Command, he would assess what military options could assist the State Department in doing so. The general’s comments came in response to a question from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who is among the lawmakers from both political parties pressing for the Biden administration to do more for the thousands of allies left behind after the Taliban swept to power in August. “I have been frustrated, frankly, by our State Department’s seeming reluctance to be as engaged as it should in this effort,” Blumenthal said during the hearing. Kurilla, commanding general of the Army’s XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C., affirmed he would prioritize the matter. Asked about the military’s options for carrying out counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan now that U.S. forces have withdrawn, Kurilla indicated that remained a work in progress. “It’s resource-intensive to be able to do the finding, and then the fixing and finishing of those targets that you’re going after,” he said, adding that drones continue to fly over Afghanistan from long distances from other partner countries. The general said that he wants to continue working with Pakistan to the extent possible. Islamabad has had an uneven and at times adversarial relationship with the United States over how to handle militant groups in the region, but Kurilla said shared interests remain. “The humanitarian crisis inside of Afghanistan threatens the migrants to push into Pakistan,” he said, alluding to waves of refugees who already have begun to leave Afghanistan. Tuesday’s wide-ranging hearing also touched on recent prison breaks at Islamic State detention centers in Syria, China’s global expansion and whether a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine would have implications in the Middle East. Kurilla, who in the near term is set to lead a headquarters unit in Germany overseeing U.S. troops deployed in response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, said he believes an invasion would likely alarm Central Asian nations like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan that were once Soviet states. The general said that Iran’s influence across the region continues to be troubling. He cited Tehran’s support for Houthi rebels in Yemen and militias in Iraq and Syria who have launched rockets at U.S. troops. The United States, Kurilla said, must expose Iran’s involvement in such actions whenever possible. “It causes them to react,” he said. “They try to hide their behavior and not take action for a time.” Kurilla, 55, is expected to face little opposition to confirmation. Several lawmakers, including Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday they believe he is right for the job. As commanding general of the XVIII Corps, Kurilla oversees more than 90,000 service members, including some of the Army’s best known units. They include the 82nd Airborne Division, the 10th Mountain Division, the 101st Airborne Division and 3rd Infantry Division. A 1988 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., he has participated in virtually all of the military’s major campaigns since joining the Army, and served each year in the Middle East from 2004 to 2014, commanding conventional and Special Operations troops as he rose through the ranks. In 2005, as battalion commander, he was wounded in a firefight in Iraq. Kurilla is expected to replace Marine Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, who has led Central Command since March 2019. He is expected to retire.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3oCyjPV,military
88,2022-02-08,Canada’s Trumpian trucker protests show the global radicalization of anti-vaxxers  ," You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest, including news from around the globe, interesting ideas, and opinions to know sent to your inbox every weekday. In Canada — yes, Canada — the confederacy of anti-vaxxers came out of the shadows for “Freedom Convoy 2022,” a protest of angry truckers that snowballed in the Ottawa winter to include a wider class of the governmentally aggrieved. At their worst, demonstrators have urinated on the National War Memorial and danced on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. But despite the lack of widespread violence, the diverse alliance of outraged citizens — from Confederate flag wavers to dancing libertarian hipsters — appear to share common purpose: shutting down the Canadian capital on a quest to end vaccine mandates. In the United States, Republican glee at the spreading, city-paralyzing protests in “liberal Canada” came under fire from Canadian officials, who insist they won’t budge on the spark that lit the demonstrations — a vaccination mandate for truckers transiting the U.S.-Canadian border. But as the convoy gains international traction — from social media to European and Australian streets — Canada is becoming an unlikely symbol of the radicalization of the anti-vaccination movement in the West that shares more than a few similarities with the militancy of Trump Republicans. The seemingly endless pandemic has brought together diverse civic forces furious over perceived government overreach. They’ve protested mandates and lockdowns as well as vaguer notions of encroachment into public life. But the scope, nature and tactics of such protests are escalating, becoming increasingly uncivil and more aggressive around the world. They include outbursts of anger and violent threats against specific politicians, far-right imagery at demonstrations, violent melees with police and, in the surprising case of Canada, the shutting down of entire cities. Parallels to the Jan. 6 insurrection may be limited in Ottawa — protesters are not knocking down the doors of Parliament. But anti-government slogans flooding Ottawa’s streets suggest similar grievances, even as their trucks serve as a flashback to the Trump caravans that menaced U.S. highways during the 2020 campaign. The absence of widespread violence in Ottawa also does not mean residents of the Canadian capital don’t feel threatened. “They’re also seeing the images that we’re all seeing, of very right-wing extremist messages: the flags that display the swastika, Confederate flags, images of a prime minister being lynched,” Catherine McKenney, an Ottawa councilor, told the Globe and Mail. “I’m not sure that I would continue to call this peaceful.” Elsewhere, the mob rule spirit of Jan. 6 lives on in the transformation of anti-vaxxers into menacing bands of aggressive harassers. On Monday in Britain, anti-vaccine protesters surrounded Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, accusing him of everything from being a “traitor” (a common slur hurled by the Trumpian right) to supporting coronavirus vaccines and also “protecting pedophiles.” Police had to come to his aid. “One witness said a protester carried a hangman’s noose prop, which another protester had joked was for Starmer,” the Guardian reported.  Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has positioned himself as a global Pied Piper for the unmasked masses. In a statement Friday, he dubbed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — a target of the Ottawa protesters — a “far left lunatic,” picking at the wound of Canadian divisions by decrying the country’s “insane covid mandates.” Eco-leftists, musicians, Marvel movie stars, hairdressers and gay rights activists — some of them even vaccinated, but still opposed to government mandates — have marched, paraded and howled across the West. They share a certain brand of unapologetic individualism, as well as a distrust of the “establishment” and, often, science. But globally, conspiracy theorists and the radical right — largely part of Trump’s flock in the United States — are increasingly co-opting the anti-vax movement. Last month, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, Austria’s head of domestic intelligence, told the AFP news service that “foreign activists” — he said they came from Germany and Switzerland — have been traveling to Austria to join local demonstrations against Europe’s broadest vaccine mandate, as well as holding “network meetings” with “right-wing extremists.” In the German state of Saxony — the epicenter of the country’s anti-vax movement, where some 50,000 people a week are protesting mandates — officials from the state’s domestic intelligence agency said the “mobilization machine” on the ground is the Free Saxons, a group it classified as a right-wing extremist movement. “The right-wing extremists know exactly how to capitalize on these conspiracy ideologies to stir up fear,” Annalena Schmidt, a former city councilor in Saxony, told The Washington Post. In New Zealand — in some ways the Canada of Oceania — local politicians have had to “beef up security after a slew of death threats” from anti-vaxxers, the Economist reported. In the Australian state of Victoria, authorities brought charges against a man who encouraged protesters to “bring out rifles and shotguns” and shoot the state’s premier over mandates. Two men in Western Australia were charged after allegedly threatening to behead its premier. “Protesters are taking inspiration from America’s far right. … Some wave flags featuring Donald Trump, wear red hats and threaten journalists,” the Economist reported. “They have started calling politicians ‘traitors’ and calling for lynchings. Placards mentioning QAnon, an incoherent conspiracy theory which is taking off in the Antipodes, are increasingly common.” The confederacy of anti-vaxxers is racking up wins in the West — while leaving a dangerous gap for coronavirus mutations to attack otherwise widely vaccinated populations. Earlier this month, Quebec Premier François Legault, citing fears of social division, abandoned a threat to tax the unvaccinated. In the Netherlands, where protests have included running battles with police using live fire, a government under pressure eased lockdown restrictions last month despite soaring infections. The movements are nationally focused but internationally linked through symbolism, the Internet and like-minded operatives. Now there’s a new source of inspiration: the Canadian truckers. The Toronto Star tracked dozens of new Facebook and Telegram groups inspired by the Canadian truckers strike, from Cyprus to Argentina. But Canada’s anti-vax moment is stirring the global pot in more than just the virtual space. In Europe, similar convoys are being planned in “all 27 European Union countries,” with organizers using the unmonitored social media app Telegram for planning and coordination. Hundreds of protesters inspired by the Canadian truckers descended on the Australian capital Monday, waving “Australian flags, military insignia and campaign banners for former U.S. president Donald Trump,” according to Bloomberg News. As Australian protesters waved signs saying “GENOCIDE” and “FREEDOM” in front of Parliament, The Post reported, the American-born Australian senator Kristina Keneally warned that the crowd contained “individuals that our national security agencies are worried about,” citing the arrest of one protest organizer last week after police allegedly found a gun in his car. “Some of these protesters actually want to undermine and overturn democracy,” Keneally said.

After blocking streets in the capital Ottawa for 10 days, the truckers brought their anti-government blockade to the Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor, Ontario, with the city of Detroit. Each day, $300 million worth of car and truck parts, agricultural products, steel and other raw materials flows across the bridge, according to Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association in Toronto. U.S. manufacturers rely on daily or near-daily shipments to and from their Canadian partners. Just one or two more days of interrupted deliveries could lead to temporary layoffs or plant closures, Volpe said. “We work in 24-48 hour contingencies. Everybody is thinking about what that means for tomorrow’s production,” he said. “A few dozen people are getting in the way of the American economy.” The Canadian protest, which began after the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau required truckers to receive the coronavirus vaccine beginning Jan. 15, represents just the latest obstacle for industrial supply chains that have struggled amid the pandemic. New car dealers in the United States have far fewer vehicles in stock than normal, leaving consumers facing high prices and long delays in obtaining their preferred models. “The inventory of new vehicles is in very short supply, so any disruption to the supply chain is not helping,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst with Cox Automotive. “It’s a tremendous amount of automotive goods that go back and forth across that bridge.” Canada was the United States’ top trading partner last year, with almost $665 billion in goods exchanged between the two countries, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. For almost 30 years, North American trade agreements have melded vehicle makers in the United States and Canada into a seamless operation. Incomplete vehicles routinely cross the northern border several times before assembly is completed. As U.S. plants run short of Canadian components, they will react by cutting their own orders to suppliers elsewhere, meaning layoffs could ripple across the industry, Volpe added. All major carmakers — GM, Ford, Toyota and Honda — have plants in Ontario. “We are aware of the issue and are managing the situation with our logistics providers to mitigate any potential problems. There are no production impacts to report at this time,” said Dan Flores, a GM spokesman. As of late Tuesday afternoon, police in Windsor had reopened one lane of U.S.-bound traffic, but were diverting commercial vehicles to the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia, roughly 60 miles away. The 1.4-mile long Ambassador Bridge, erected in 1929, has been closed in the past by snow or accidents. The Blue Water Bridge offers an alternative, though it means a longer, less efficient route. The Windsor Police said in a statement that a large police presence was monitoring the protest along Huron Church Road, the main link to the bridge on the Canadian side of the Detroit River. “Our focus is on maintaining open communications with organizers of the demonstrations and using a reasoned, tempered approach, including the appropriate use of police discretion to guide our police personnel's responses,” the Windsor Police said. The protesters in Ottawa have brought the Canadian capital to a standstill using hundreds of parked trucks. After objecting to the government’s vaccine mandate, they have expanded their campaign to seek the end of all coronavirus restrictions. Tom Marazzo, a spokesman for the group behind the original convoy, reiterated Tuesday that the protesters want to overthrow the government of Trudeau, according to the Associated Press. The protesters have infuriated residents of Ottawa by blocking traffic, constantly sounding their air horns, harassing people who wear masks and displaying the Confederate flag and swastika. François Laporte, the president of Teamsters Canada, the union representing 55,000 drivers, disavowed the protest, saying it did not represent the concerns of his members. In a statement, Laporte said 90 percent of the union’s long-haul drivers had been vaccinated. “The so-called ‘freedom convoy’ and the despicable display of hate lead by the political Right and shamefully encouraged by elected conservative politicians does not reflect the values of Teamsters Canada, nor the vast majority of our members, and in fact has served to delegitimize the real concerns of most truck drivers today,” Laporte said.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3HEL18q,economy
90,2022-02-08,Can`t get a Bing Dwen Dwen? Chinese factories resume work early to increase supply,"Bing Dwen Dwen Photo:VCGFor those who want a Bing Dwen Dwen but sadly find it already out of stock in all the stores they visit, Chinese manufacturers are now mobilizing workers to come back earlier from the Spring Festival holidays for production of the panda mascot of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, to ensure that every desperate fan can take one home as soon as possible.Wrapped in a layer of ice, resembling an astronaut, the cute fluffy panda has emerged as a fan favorite during the ongoing Beijing Winter Games amid a whole-of-society Olympics fever, resulting in a global ""buying spree"" of related products.Several manufacturing plants across the country, most of which were still closed for the Lunar New Year, which overlaps with the Olympics, told the Global Times on Tuesday that they've already quickly resumed work, and they're devoted to production of the chubby panda to rapidly increase supply.According to the official website of the Beijing Winter Olympics, there are 29 licensed manufacturers of the Winter Olympics across the country, producing badges, key chains, plush toys, handicrafts, outdoor products and other licensed products.A licensed manufacturer of Bing Dwen Dwen plush toys in East China's Zhejiang Province said that the firm has already resumed production ahead of schedule, and is currently preparing materials and stocking up. ""We've also been negotiating with various departments, including raw materials firms, to quickly get into production,"" a manager of the firm told the Global Times.A staffer surnamed Chen at Shunmei Group, a porcelain crafts maker in Dehua, East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times that the factory has quickly resumed operation, and now has to work overtime to catch up with the huge demand.The factory produces two sizes of porcelain Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon figures, all hand-made, the bigger one priced at 278 yuan ($43.70), and the smaller one sold at 198 yuan. ""Sales of the products were great and the first batch of stock has sold out,"" said Chen of Shunmei Group. She said consumers can now only pre-order the figures, revealing that the company's sales on Sunday reached 100,000 yuan. The next batch of products is estimated to be delivered after February 25, Chen said. ""I can promise that every customer who has already placed an order will receive what they ordered after the 25th,"" said Chen.Most of the mascot-themed items, including keychains and throw pillows, were shown to be out of stock on the flagship stores for Olympics merchandise on Tmall and JD.com, the two main Chinese online retailers. Shoppers are willing to line up in the bitter pre-dawn cold outside of flagship stores for several hours to buy one of the figurines, and some shops even set a limit of one mascot souvenir for each customer.Globally, the Bing Dwen Dwen hashtag has also been a hot topic on social media platforms like Twitter.Guo Lei, an official from the Beijing 2022 organizing committee, said on Tuesday that the temporary lack of inventory for a range of 2022 Winter Olympic Games-related merchandise, including Bing Dwen Dwen, was caused by sudden surges in demand and yet-to-recover production capacity following the Spring Festival holidays.But, after several rounds of consultations with manufacturers, several factories have gradually resumed production and have taken various proactive measures to increase production, which will result in an uninterrupted supply soon, Guo told a press conference, adding that the committee attaches great importance to the issue. The official said that 2022 Winter Olympic Games-related merchandise includes 16 main categories and over 5,000 different products, which will remain on sale until the end of June, urging fans to buy the souvenirs through proper channels and avoid illegal activities such as price gouging and speculation.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251757.shtml,source/economy
91,2022-02-08,‘Carrie Antoinette’: Boris Johnson’s wife is being blamed for his scandals," LONDON — Many longtime observers of Boris Johnson say this British prime minister doesn’t need any help getting into hot water. It’s his natural habitat. But with Johnson’s government immersed in a scandal entering its third month, attention has turned to the role and influence of Carrie Johnson, the 33-year-old third wife of the prime minister, formerly a senior communications aide, a message shaper, a spinner, for the Conservative Party. Insiders have called her “Princess Nut Nuts” and “Carrie Antoinette.” They compare her to Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth — ruthless, ambitious and a little mad. Carrie critics have blamed her for everything from parties that may have violated coronavirus restrictions to preventing her husband from becoming a great leader. The broadside against the prime minister’s spouse has been the talk of the Westminster bubble. Some have branded the critique unfair, even misogynistic. Blame the wife, seriously? They note that when Boris Johnson is flying high and winning landslide elections, nobody implicates Carrie. Others say Carrie has played an outsize role in Johnson’s premiership — for better or worse. The debate over the role of the prime minister’s wife exploded into full public view over the weekend, when Michael Ashcroft — Lord Ashcroft, a Conservative Party peer — published a serialized excerpt of his new book, “First Lady: Intrigue at the Court of Carrie and Boris Johnson,” in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. Ashcroft claims that Carrie Johnson has influenced her husband’s staffing decisions, his messaging, his decision to go big on fighting climate change — and his stumbles. In the tabloid, Ashcroft charged, “Carrie is the reason Boris has squandered the chance to become a great Prime Minister.” He wrote that her behavior is preventing Johnson from “leading Britain as effectively as the voters deserve.” The excerpt was enough to inspire a rare response from Carrie Johnson’s personal spokeswoman, who said in a statement Sunday night that “Yet again Mrs. Johnson has been targeted by a brutal briefing campaign against her by enemies of her husband.” The spokeswoman called this “just the latest attempt by bitter ex-officials to discredit her. She is a private individual who plays no role in government.” On Monday, her former boss, Health Secretary Sajid Javid, said the intense focus on Carrie was “very, very different” from other spouses of past prime ministers. When a broadcaster asked if Carrie were not “a critical player in British politics,” Javid objected. “She was a special adviser, she was working at campaign headquarters. She is no longer,” the health secretary told the BBC. “She is the spouse of the prime minister, her residency is of course in Downing Street, she’s the mother of two children. I just think the kind of focus that we’re seeing on her now is undignified and unfair.” What to know about Carrie Johnson? She’s famously in love with animals, hates plastic waste, has a rescue dog named Dilyn, is keen on fighting global warming, and works to save the whales and sea life as an adviser to the environmental group Oceana. She has been the crosshairs for a long while, really since the couple began dating. One of their early spats, with some spilled red wine, was a scoop for the Guardian newspaper. As for her role in “Partygate” — a string of parties at the prime minister’s office and residence during pandemic shutdowns, now the subject of a criminal investigation by police — ITV News reported that Carrie organized cake and a “Happy Birthday” singalong for her husband in the Cabinet Room. And the Telegraph reported that she hosted an Abba-themed party to celebrate the departure of top aide Dominic Cummings — a departure said to be partly the result of her interventions. Cummings, who has since branded his former boss Boris unfit for office, recently wrote on his blog that Carrie Johnson was “a dreadful influence.” Carrie Johnson also appears among staffers and bottles of wine at what Downing Street has maintained was a work event in the back garden. Police are not investigating that gathering, though the other two involving the prime minister’s wife are on their list. The scandal has led to the departure of some of Downing Street’s most senior staffers. Carrie critics noted that she is among the few to survive the shake-up. Critics also blame her, in part, for bad headlines that followed the luxury redecorating — paid for by a rich donor — at the couple’s official residence at 11 Downing Street and for the controversial decision to evacuate abandoned pets from a charity shelter in Kabul run by a former British soldier. In his excerpt, Ashcroft reported that during Boris Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign for the Conservative Party, it looked like Carrie Johnson had a hold on his phone. “We’d spot the different ways things were written, because the style would change. We’d learn to spot when it was her writing the message,” a source told Ashcroft. Boris Johnson was asked Monday whether he takes political advice from his wife — and whether the criticism of her is fair. The prime minister replied, “I think it’s entirely fair for people to focus on the issues that I’m focused on, and that is, number one, our priority, which is to tackle the covid backlogs and rebuild our economy.” Others who have come to Carrie Johnson’s defense have called out what they see as sexism. “The trouble is, it’s always the easiest thing to do to blame the woman and the truth is far more complicated than that,” said columnist Sarah Vine, who is recently divorced from a top government minister and Johnson ally, Michael Gove. Vine told the BBC, “If Boris Johnson has given Carrie too much access or too much leeway, that’s sort of his fault. He is the person in charge. He is the prime minister.” She added: “I know that the nickname Carrie Antoinette is witty and a good pun and we all love a good pun, but I just don't think her head deserves to be on the block in this way.” Sandra Howard, the former spouse of Michael Howard, who once led the Conservative Party, said she had “great sympathy” for Carrie Johnson. “The focus is unfairly angled at her as a woman, as well,” she told the BBC on Monday. “It’s just better you don’t try and heap blame where it’s unclear.” Kwasi Kwarteng, the government’s business secretary, said Carrie Johnson has her own opinions but denied “she’s got an undue influence.” Kwarteng told Times Radio, “The prime minister has been in politics for 25 years, and has a pretty strong set of ideas.” Paul Goodman, the editor of the ConservativeHome website, which is owned by Ashcroft, wrote on Monday that the idea that the prime minister’s wife stunted Johnson’s premiership is “the consensus view in Westminster,” among Conservative Party ministers, lawmakers and special advisers. Goodman noted, though, “whether the charge is true or not, it deflects from the main point. Which is that the Prime Minister himself, not his spouse, bears responsibility for his decisions.” Karla Adam contributed to this report.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3uxi3DG,europe
92,2022-02-08,China announces eased financing rules for rental of affordable homes,"China's central bank Photo: VCG Chinaâs central bank on Tuesday announced eased financing rules for rental of affordable homes, as part of a broader push for housing market sustainability.Loans to real estate projects certified as affordable housing for rent will no longer be subject to a property credit concentration regulation, according to a statement jointly released Tuesday by the Peopleâs Bank of China (PBC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).At the end of 2020, the PBC and the CBIRC put a cap on banksâ outstanding property loans as a part of their total lending and their outstanding mortgages versus total lending.Banks have been urged to step up support for affordable rental homes and to provide financial products and services in a manner thatâs law-based, controllable in risk terms and commercially sustainable, the statement said. The Tuesday statement will boost rental of affordable homes, Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Property developers will be encouraged to apply for loans specifically allocated to affordable housing, according to Yan, noting that the loan-capping regulation remains in place.China has been trying to curb excessive property loans for some time, with the evolution of the Evergrande debt issue casting a cloud over the countryâs housing market last year. Throughout 2021, there were nine domestic property bond issuers that confirmed de facto defaults or triggered cross-default clauses, involving 44 bonds, an increase of 80 percent from the year before, Chinese industry portal fangchan.com reported Tuesday, citing a recent report on developersâ credit.That suggests a corresponding debt issuance of 57.29 billion yuan ($9 billion), a surge of 82.16 percent year-on-year from the whole of 2020, per the report.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251783.shtml,source/economy

94,2022-02-08,China urges US to correct mistake in targeting 33 Chinese firms,"The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) Photo: VCGChina on Tuesday urged the US to immediately correct its mistake after the US Commerce Department added 33 Chinese entities to a so-called unverified list to restrict their ability to receive shipments from US exporters, a move that Chinese officials and experts condemned as long-arm jurisdiction and a disruption to international trade order.Some Chinese companies that were targeted by the US move were defiant, with some telling the Global Times on Tuesday that they see no real impact as they don't even import products from the US, while others are working actively to cope with the crackdown.In a statement on Tuesday, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said that China firmly opposes the US' move, while excoriating the US' multi-year political crackdown and economic bullying against companies. ""In recent years, the US has been using export controls as a tool of a political crackdown and economic bullying, constantly taking unilateral measures to crack down on foreign enterprises, institutions and individuals, which has caused damage to normal economic and trade ties between China and the US, harmed international trade rules and posed a serious threat to the global industry chain,"" the MOFCOM said.The ministry urged the US to immediately correct its wrongdoings, return to the right track of win-win cooperation, and contribute to the stability of the global industry and supply chains and the recovery of the world economy.The US Commerce Department on Monday said it had added 33 entities in China to its unverified list (UVL), also known as a red-flag list, for receiving US exports, saying that it was unable to establish the legitimacy of the entities and how export items would be used by them.US exporters will now need a license to ship products to any of the companies on the list, while the Chinese companies must certify that they are legitimate and willing to comply with US regulations to come off the list.But some Chinese companies that were targeted were defiant on Tuesday, saying that they see little impact from being added to the US' so-called unverified list.Shenzhen Haimuxing Laser Technology Co said in a statement that there has been no significant impact on the operational or financial status of the company after one of its subsidiaries was put on the list.Hefei Anxin Reed Precision Manufacturing Co, one of the enterprises on the list, said it was aware of the issue and was taking active steps to cope with the situation. ""The US products only account for a small proportion of our imports. It is not clear what impact entering the list will have on our company,"" the company told the Global Times in a statement on Tuesday.Others said they don't even trade with US companies at the moment. Kunshan Heng Rui Cheng Industrial Technology Co told the Global Times that it has no imported products from the US.Chinese pharmaceutical company WuXi Biologics said on Tuesday that it has seen no impact on its business after two of its subsidiaries were placed on the list, though its shares in Hong Kong plunged more than 30 percent on Tuesday morning before trading was halted.In a conference call held by China Securities Co, senior executives from WuXi Biologics said that the main reason for its addition to the list is that the US Department of Commerce cannot come to China for verification due to the COVID-19.The addition of the 33 Chinese companies brings the total number of listed entities to more than 170. Companies from Russia and the United Arab Emirates were among other countries on the list.It is not surprising that the US has added 33 Chinese companies to the list, which is a continuation of the crackdown on Chinese high-tech companies that began under the Trump administration, and it is in line with the US Congress passing of the so-called America Competes Act of 2022, Dong Shaopeng, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""The move showed that the US has felt panic as China gradually moves to the high end of the industry chain,"" Dong said, adding that the abuse of so-called national security concerns to suppress high-tech enterprises will harm both US and Chinese companies.Trade protectionism is also hurting US businesses, experts said.The US will slowly lose the Chinese market after imposing export controls while the imposition of added tariffs on some daily necessities will directly affect consumer prices in the US and increase inflationary pressure, Bai Ming, deputy director of the international market research institute at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Tuesday.On Monday, 41 US senators wrote to the office of the US Trade Representative asking the agency to create a more comprehensive process to exclude some Chinese imports from punitive tariffs. ""The calls from US society for comprehensive exclusions from tariffs placed on products from China showed that the sanctions imposed by some US politicians are a departure from economic rationality and harm the US economy,"" Bai said.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251771.shtml,source/economy

(eng.chinamil.com.cn/Photo by Zeng Bingyang)China on Tuesday vowed to take countermeasures after the US announced a plan to sell $100 million worth of Patriot missile upgrades to the island of Taiwan, which would be the first US arms sale to the island in 2022 and the second under the Biden administration.The arms sale, again leeching money from Taiwan, will not bring safety to ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists but instead push the island further toward catastrophe, said experts.The sales of weapons by the US to China's Taiwan severely violates the one-China principle and the regulations of the three Joint CommuniquÃ©s between China and the US, especially those in the August 17 communiquÃ©, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular press conference on Tuesday.It severely harms China's sovereignty and security interests, China-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, Zhao said. ""China firmly opposes and strongly condemns this. ""China urged the US to abide by the one-China principle and regulations of the three Joint CommuniquÃ©s, cancel the arms sale plan immediately and cut off military ties with Taiwan, Zhao said.China will take proper, powerful measures to resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and security interests, Zhao said.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson at the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Tuesday that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority is seeking ""independence"" and making provocations by colluding with external forces, abusing the hard-earned money of the people in Taiwan to buy US weapons, but this cannot save ""Taiwan independence"" forces' destiny of doom and will only escalate tensions in the Taiwan Straits and push Taiwan into catastrophe.The remarks by Zhao and Ma come after the Pentagon announced on Monday that it approved a possible $100 million sale of equipment and services to the island of Taiwan to ""sustain, maintain, and improve"" its Patriot missile defense system, Reuters reported on the day.A statement from the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said it had delivered the required certification notifying Congress following State Department approval for the sale, Reuters reported, noting that the main contractors would be Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin.This will be the first US arms sale to Taiwan in 2022, and the second under the Biden administration, following the $750 million sale of M109A6 self-propelled howitzers plus related equipment and services announced in August 2021.Zheng Jian, director of the National Taiwan Research Association and a chair professor at the Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies of Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US is trying to upset China while it is hosting the Winter Olympics.Such arms sales cannot bring safety to ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists but instead invite more military pressure from the Chinese mainland, Zheng said.This is also not the first time the island of Taiwan has paid for upgrades for Patriot missiles. In July 2020, the US announced the approval of an arms deal to Taiwan the recertification of Patriot air defense missiles for $620 million.Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US is using Patriot missiles to leech money from Taiwan, since the missiles would need constant upgrades and maintenance.The US wants to earn more money and boost ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists' ambitions at the same time, but does not care if the weapons are useful against the Chinese mainland, Song said.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251755.shtml,china/military

According to the monitor of NDRC, price ratio between pork and grain came in at 5.57:1 during the week starting January 24. The ratio had been in the range between 5:1 to 6:1 for three continuous weeks, which was the alert range marking the excessive decline of pork price level set by market regulators. NDRC plans to launch a stockpile campaign across the country and deploy related guidance to various local governments.The price of pork in China saw a decline during the first three weeks in January as the Spring Festival arrived at the end of the month with the wholesale price of pork being at about 26.24 yuan ($4.14) per kilogram. Analysts suggested that in order to stabilize pork supplies and prices, authorities should strengthen pork reserves to regulate market supply and demand, as well as providing market information as references to market participants.

97,2022-02-08,Chinese financial regulators to establish legal standards for digital currency,"A view of the PBC's headquarters in Beijing Photo: cnsphotoFour Chinese financial departments and regulatory agencies have vowed to steadily promote the establishment and development of legal standards for a digital currency, according to a statement from the country's central bank on Tuesday. The People's Bank of China (PBC), the State Administration for Market Regulation, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued a development plan targeting standardizing the finance sector during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25). The plan places a strong focus on legalizing the digital currency, aiming to come up with legal standards for the issuance, technology, security and other processes involved in the transactions of the digital currency, while establishing and regulating the testing indexes of related systems and products. Analysts stressed the importance and necessity of establishing centralized standards to manage the digital currency and maintain the sound development of the industry, especially with the wide use and promotion of the digital yuan in many areas, including at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Some people have been engaging in unlawful activities under the guise of using digital currencies to obtain illegal profits in the past, which have disrupted the normal market order, Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Liu added that the sector can achieve sound and orderly development if it is managed by the national-level financial supervision and decision-making authorities. The digital yuan has been widely tested in many places across the country. During the ongoing Beijing Winter Olympics, consumers can use a wide range of digital yuan products and enjoy the convenience of mobile payments within the country. Merchants, contracted hotels and designated hospitals within the restricted areas in competition venues all support the use of the digital yuan, while people can also use this method of payment with merchants outside the restricted areas with signs showing the digital yuan, the Shanghai Securities News reported. Liu said that the broad use and application scenarios of the digital yuan are based on previously implemented standards and trials. He also noted that establishing standards will boost the efficient development of the industry, which has focused more on speed rather than standardized development in the past. As a result, the industry's development has encountered obstacles due to a lack of proper guidance. The development plan sets the goal that a standardized financial system will be basically completed by 2025 that will integrate financial supervision, markets and services, while the country's financial industry will develop with high quality, supported by a high level of standardization.

98,2022-02-08,"COVID-19 outbreak in S.China`s Guangxi, major aluminum production hub, boosts price","Residents line to take nucleic acid tests in Debao county, Baise, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on February 6, 2022. Photo: VCGA new COVID-19 outbreak in Baise in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a major domestic production hub of aluminum, is expected to tighten supply and lift prices amid booming demand and low inventories after the Chinese New Year holidays.The city accounts for 5.6 percent of China's total production of electrolytic aluminum, and interruptions to production will push up prices for raw materials upstream, along with other factors, industry insiders said. Production in Baise has been suspended amid a citywide lockdown for epidemic prevention, according to industry sources. A manager with Guangxi Yangyang Aluminum told the Global Times on Tuesday that production was halted on the first working day after the Chinese New Year holiday due to epidemic prevention. The company is awaiting notice to resume, and it's hard to tell at the moment what the business impact will be. Another person with a local aluminum company said the production suspension drove up prices by ""hundreds of yuan per ton"" in a single day on Monday and Tuesday. ""We are now in a situation where the price is rising but these orders were taken before and during the Chinese New Year, when the price was lower,"" the person said, so the company faces some potential losses.Baise launched citywide traffic controls on Sunday, barring all vehicles and people from entering and leaving, as part of the latest measures for the strict but necessary epidemic prevention in responding to the latest outbreak in the region.As of 5 pm on Monday, there were 66 new confirmed cases reported in the previous 24 hours in Baise, taking the total confirmed cases to 102. ""Epidemic prevention, which led to the production and transport restrictions in Baise, will surely boost the market price for corresponding materials such as alumina and electrolytic aluminum,"" Chen Huan, an industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.But as the outbreak in Baise has just started, the actual impact on the middle and downstream industry is still too early to assess, Chen said.Baise's annual alumina production capacity is up to 10 million tons, or 13.8 percent of total domestic capacity. Electrolytic aluminum production capacity in the city takes up to 80 percent of the whole figure for Guangxi, and 4-5 percent of China.Booming demand coupled with the traffic controls in Baise are likely to mean lower inventories and higher prices.While there are still around 7-10 days of inventories left in Guangxi, companies face challenges in preparing the necessary raw materials once the anti-virus measures end, according to media reports.The domestic market has been optimistic about the recovery of aluminum consumption after the Spring Festival. The scale of accumulated storage around the Spring Festival in 2022 is expected to be the lowest in the past five years, according to the Shanghai Metals Market (SMM), an industry news portal.Shares of aluminum companies rose on Tuesday, with Yunnan Aluminium Co surging 8.13 percent.

99,2022-02-08,Culture and feelings of China's Korean ethnic minority should be respected and so-called 'cultural appropriation' is groundless: Chinese Embassy in Seoul,"People pass Chinese national flag at the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Photo: Sina.comThe Chinese Embassy in South Korea said in a statement on its official WeChat account on Tuesday that accusations of ""cultural appropriation"" for China's Korean ethnic minority at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics wearing ethnic costumes are groundless. China respects the history, culture and traditions of South Korea and hopes that the feelings of all ethnic groups in China, including the Korean ethnicity, can be respected.The statement from the Chinese Embassy in Seoul stressed that China is a multi-ethnic country composed of 56 ethnic groups. It is not only their wish but also their right for representatives of all ethnic groups to wear their ethnic costumes at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, an international sports event and major national event.A Chinese girl dressed in the traditional costume of China's Korean ethnic minority appeared among those representing China's 56 ethnic groups during the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics on February 4, sparking controversy in South Korea.Some South Korean politicians and activists criticized what they called China's ""cultural appropriation"" and ""cultural engineering"" for the appearance of Korean ethnic elements in the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics. ""We deeply regret that the Hanbok [the traditional Korean costume used in South Korea] appeared among the costumes of Chinese minorities at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics,"" South Korean ruling party lawmaker, Lee So-young, wrote on her Facebook page on Saturday, according to media report. ""This is not the first time China has introduced Korean culture as if it were its own. [...] If the anti-China sentiment of the Korean people becomes stronger by leaving this issue as is, it will be a big obstacle when conducting diplomacy with China in the future,"" Lee said.A number of South Korean politicians also spoke out in recent days calling for respect and understanding toward both cultures. National Assembly Speaker, Park Byeong-seug, who attended the opening ceremony in Beijing, said that the ""Hanbok is one of the most representative elements of South Korean culture, no one would doubt this, and the South Korean people need to be proud of its culture."" However, Park noted that, as around 120 million people belong to 55 ethnic minorities in China, there also is a need to understand and respect the Chinese culture. He added that both countries should respect each other's inherent culture, especially during this trip to Beijing. Park further highlighted the need to improve the understanding of diversity, and the urgency to open the market for cultural content.According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China is home to nearly 2 million people from Korean ethnicity, which is a recognized minority group whose language and culture are granted official protection by the Chinese government.The Chinese Embassy also stressed that ethnic Koreans in China and both sides of the Korean Peninsula are of the same root and share the same heritage, including traditional ethnic costumes.The South Korean Foreign Ministry official also said on Sunday that they will develop more understanding toward each other, based on mutual respect for their culture and diversity, and will continue to do so in the future.Hwang Hee, Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of South Korea, who also attended Friday's opening ceremony in Beijing, said his government had no plans to officially file a complaint to Beijing over the costume issue, but added that while the costume was intended to highlight the Korean ethnicity in China, it ""may create unfortunate misunderstandings"" between the two countries. The Chinese Embassy said that this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and South Korea and is also the year of cultural exchange between the two countries. It is hoped that the two sides will work together to deepen cooperation, promote friendship between both peoples and strive for further progress in bilateral relations.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251791.shtml,china/diplomacy
100,2022-02-08,Dutton uses hard-line stance on China to become next Aussie leader,"Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton Photo: AFPTo pursue a favorable position in the upcoming elections by means of showing a hard-line stance and badmouthing China is despicable even for Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton. ""The US and others acquiesced and allowed the militarization now to the point where China has 20 points of presence in the South China Sea, which does not help stability in the region,"" Dutton said in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday. Dutton added, ""If we [Australia] continue on that trajectory, then I think we'll lose the next decade. ""Australian federal elections are scheduled in May. ""Dutton is a potential rival of incumbent Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. With the election looming, Dutton intends to pile some pressure on Morrison, in a bid to gain more political capital. Dutton challenged former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018. Although the attempt failed, his ambition to become prime minister still remains. He may harbor thoughts of becoming the next Liberal leader, replacing Morrison,"" Chen Hong, a professor and director of the Australian Studies Center of East China Normal University, told the Global Times.In recent years, to pursue their political gains, some Australian anti-China forces have repeatedly fabricated the so-called China threat theory. Such practices have deceived the Australians and have led China-Australia relations to a freezing point. Dutton, a representative of China hawks in Australia, has repeatedly made tough and noisy remarks against China especially since he was sworn in as the minister for defense in March 2021. By virtue of these lines, he has gained much attention both at home and aboard. So far, he tends to treat making hard-line words toward China, hyping the China threat theory, and provoking China as a means to fish for political capital, which is very contemptible.Dutton's ambition to become the next prime minister will encourage him to act more desperately on China-related issues. He has prioritized his own political interests over China-Australia relations as well as Australia's national interests. As a result, ties between Beijing and Canberra will be the victim of his political interests.Furthermore, when reporting on Dutton's rhetoric, some Western media outlets mentioned the background of the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Australia this week, Chen said. By hyping the so-called China threat theory, Dutton also hopes to provoke the US into ramping up its confrontation with China amid Blinken's visit. His lines embodied Australia's strategic frustration and anxiety.Since some Australian politicians adhere to provoking disputes with China, relations have plummeted, official exchanges have almost disappeared, and their economic and trade relations have also been affected. But the US, which Australia heavily relies on in its China policy, still continues exchanges between top officials with China. And trade between China and the US reached a record high in 2021. Against this backdrop, Australia is very worried that the US will discard it one day. As a result, it deliberately stirred up trouble in an attempt to urge the US and other allies to confront China.But Blinken seems to put more weight on the Quad foreign ministerial meeting in his visit to Australia. And Dutton's tough lines on China will have little effect on the US, as Washington's China policy is consistent, and will not change because of what Dutton said.",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251763.shtml,opinion/observer

The snowboard waxing vehicle uses multiple advanced technologies, including hydrogen power sources, photovoltaic power generation, 5G communication, live broadcast and bionic light sources for waxers and athletes, according to the developer.The vehicle has the largest usable area among similar products worldwide of 92.5 square meters, with 21 meters in length and 10 meters in width. It is also said to be the world's most functional snowboard waxing vehicle, as it can work in many areas, including during athletes' warm-ups, storage, shower rooms, toilets and elevators for disabled athletes.Snowboards of skiing athletes need to be waxed in order to ensure speed when they are racing. The vehicle is a mobile waxing workshop that can be deployed at any location to support athletes during training or formal games.Though it made its debut at the Winter Games, the vehicle has been used by China's skiing team for a while. Developed by a research group initiated by East China's Shandong Province government and combined with multiple local departments and sports equipment providers, the vehicle was officially handed over to the Chinese national skiing team at the end of October 2021. Then it was quickly put into use in the training program and formal games of the Chinese national cross-country skiing team in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions.It also participated in the national skiing team's activities in North China's Hebei Province and in Shanghai before the Beijing 2022 games, said as staff from Shandong Sports Industry Group, one of the member companies of the research group. He told the Global Times on Monday that the machine has traveled 15,000 kilometers.In another key technological achievement, the vehicle's heating system can maintain the inner temperature of the vehicle between 15-25 C even if the outside temperature falls down to -50 C.

He accused European countries of applying ""double standards,"" given the groups were subject to Interpol-issued worldwide requests to detain their members.Copenhagen has accused Tehran of a plot to eliminate the senior ASMLA official, in retaliation for a September 2018 attack in Ahvaz, capital of Iran's southwestern Khuzestan province, that left 24 people dead.Tehran at the time accused Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain of harboring members of the group, which Iran accused of being responsible for the attack in Ahvaz.AFP",Global Times(China),https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1251739.shtml,world/mid-east

106,2022-02-08,Virginia House panel strikes down effort to remove same-sex marriage ban from constitution," A Virginia House subcommittee struck down legislation Tuesday that would have given voters a chance to decide if the state should remove a now-defunct provision in the state constitution banning same-sex marriage. In 2006, Virginians passed a measure, known as the Marshall-Newman Amendment, that banned same-sex marriage by defining marriage in the constitution as “only a union between one man and one woman.” That language remains, even after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2015 and struck down state laws banning it. The GOP-led House Privileges and Elections Subcommittee on Tuesday voted 6 to 4 against a resolution and bill that would have put a question on the November ballot asking voters whether the provision should be removed with a new amendment. “Our Marshall-Newman Amendment was no longer enforceable,” said Del. Mark D. Sickles (D-Fairfax), the sponsor of the legislation. “Yet it sits in its utter ugliness in our constitution.” To change the state constitution, a proposed amendment must pass through the General Assembly twice before going to a public vote in a general election. The amendment to remove the marriage provision passed both chambers of the Democratic-controlled legislature last year, but the effort faces pushback since Republicans’ House takeover. The House will probably revisit the issue if the Democratic-controlled Senate passes the matching amendment, proposed by Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria). Sickles’s amendment would have replaced the portion of the constitution defining marriage as being between one man and one woman with language that reads: “The right to marry is a fundamental right, inherent in the liberty of persons, and marriage is one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness.” Del. Christopher T. Head (R-Botetourt), chairman of the subcommittee that voted down the legislation, declined to comment on his vote. One GOP staffer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations, said Republicans were concerned that the bill’s language was imprecise. If the proposed amendment simply removed the ban on same-sex marriage, or specified that marriage was between two consenting adults, it might get some GOP support, the aide said. But the current proposed language, the aide said, only creates a right to marriage and could open the door to polygamy. During the public comment period in the subcommittee meeting, a representative from the Family Foundation of Virginia raised similar concerns, including the possibility of child marriage. Virginia has laws prohibiting polygamy, intrafamily marriage and child marriage. Sickles said he had heard talk of such objections to the amendment but did not believe it. “Polygamy is against the law in Virginia,” he said. Republicans “admitted to me afterward that they wouldn’t support this … regardless of that language. They make this stuff up to make what they’re doing seem more reasonable.” Del. Dawn M. Adams (D-Richmond), the first openly gay woman to serve in the Virginia General Assembly, spoke during the subcommittee meeting, saying it was offensive to put same-sex marriage alongside the other types that are specifically outlawed in Virginia. “This matters to people, and it’s not hurting anybody, and it’s not hurting God,” Adams said through tears. “And it’s offensive to be lumped into polygamy and all kinds of other crazy stuff.” Ebbin said he was confident that his Senate version could reach the House later in the legislative session. Tuesday’s vote, however, cast doubt on the future of that bill. “Based on today’s action, it looks like it’s a bit of an uphill slog. But I’m not prepared to give up,” said Ebbin, who in 2003 became the first openly gay person elected to Virginia’s General Assembly. “LGBTQ people deserve equality under the law, and we deserve to be included in the laws as the Supreme Court has recognized.” Democratic lawmakers and LGBTQ rights groups have discussed the possibility of pressuring more moderate Republicans from suburban parts of the commonwealth to support a constitutional amendment. Only three members of the GOP would need to sign on to ensure its appearance on the ballot in November. But the question of same-sex marriage has in recent years been a subject of debate among Virginia Republicans. Even as some GOP lawmakers have offered their support for bills fighting housing discrimination, LGBTQ rights have remained a tough sell among more conservative members of the party. In 2020, former congressman Denver Riggleman (R) lost a primary challenge from his right after he presided over a same-sex wedding. And the following year, an anonymous cellphone text was sent to Republicans at the party’s convention accusing one candidate for lieutenant governor of being “a gay Democrat.” Sickles said many people have changed their minds about same-sex marriage since Virginia passed the Marshall-Newman Amendment. He said Republicans are denying voters “a chance to make up for something that they wish they hadn’t done in 2006.” During the subcommittee meeting, Jeff Caruso of the Virginia Catholic Conference spoke against the legislation. Virginia voters had decided upon the provision, Caruso argued, and if federal laws were to change, Virginia wouldn’t be able to go back to the law it had before. “In light of current federal law, it is a dormant provision, but federal laws can change. A state law that is dormant now would become effective again if the federal law changes, but only if the state law remains on the books,” Caruso said. “If you believe as we do, that marriage is the union of one man and one woman and that we should preserve this original design, please vote to continue reflecting that in our state constitution.” Others spoke in favor of the legislation, calling it a way to better reflect equality under the commonwealth’s constitution. “Marriage equality is a law of the land reflected in the Virginia code,” said Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, “and it’s time for the Virginia constitution to reflect that reality.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3LjmsQq,virginia politics
107,2022-02-08,What a postpartum doula does in a workday," Welcome to The Work Day, a series that charts a single day in various women’s working lives — from gallery owners to stay-at-home parents to chief executives. In this installment, we hear from Terrah Mulligan, a certified postpartum doula who recorded a workday in February. Interested in contributing to a future installment of The Work Day? Fill out this form. Name: Terrah Mulligan Age: 42 Location: Fairfield, Conn. Job title: Certified postpartum doula and owner of Bloom Postpartum Care Previous jobs: During college, I worked as a restaurant server and live-in nanny. After college, I worked as a retail manager for several different companies before becoming a stay-at-home mom after my first child was born in 2006. I got certified as a postpartum doula three years ago. What led me to my current role: I loved being a stay-at-home mom and found the experience fulfilling and rewarding. A lot of my friends felt like they lost their identity when they left the workforce to stay home — but I felt like I found mine. When my oldest turned 13, I finally felt ready to go back to work, but had no desire to return to retail. I wanted to work with new moms and/or babies, so when I learned there was a job where I could do both, I knew I had found my calling. I struggled with a lot of postpartum anxiety after the birth of each of my children, and I felt so overwhelmed a lot of the time. I never knew how or where to ask for help. Helping parents navigate the postpartum period and have a better experience than I did really feels like coming full circle, and that has been so meaningful. How I spend the majority of my day: Most of my day is spent working directly in the homes of my clients. I typically work with families for two to three months. My services include infant care, breastfeeding support and education, meal prep, laundry, light house cleaning, sibling care, baby wearing and baby massage tutorials, and developmental checks. I also help families better organize their living spaces to make caring for a newborn easier. And finally, I spend a lot of time listening. Many new moms (and partners!) just need to talk to a nonjudgmental, nonmedical professional about what they’re struggling with, what they’re scared about, what they thought would be easy and isn’t, etc. An important part of my job is just holding the space for them to do that. 6 a.m.: Wake up and make coffee. My daughter’s bus comes at 6:40, so I’m up at 6 to get her breakfast started and pack all the lunches. Coffee is a very important part of this! 7:30 a.m.: Workout. After my boys get on their bus, I usually try to sneak in a workout if I can. If I save it for later in the day, I know it won’t happen, and it’s a good time to clear my head before the workday starts. I shower and put on comfortable clothes — leggings and a sweater most days. Postpartum work can get very messy and I’m on my feet all day, so comfort is key. 9 a.m.: I arrive at my clients’ house. The first 20 minutes or so are spent talking about the previous night or day. How did breastfeeding or bottle feeding go, how often did the baby wake during the night, how many poops and pees have there been, etc. I also always ask, “How are you feeling today?” It’s important to gauge where the mom is emotionally, because that will dictate what I spend my time doing for that shift. If the mom seems to be really struggling and exhausted, then my priority is to give her time to rest, take a long shower and eat a warm meal by herself. I’ll leave extra time for her to talk, cry or vent if she needs to. I’ll take over baby duties and maybe try to talk to the partner and come up with a plan. 10 a.m.: I always start a load of laundry right away, make the bed and clean the kitchen. It’s the little things that begin to feel overwhelming once you bring a newborn home, so I try to make sure all those tasks get completed while I’m there. Tummy time, when you lay a baby on its stomach to help strengthen muscles, is one of my favorite things to teach. While most parents are aware of the importance of tummy time for newborns, many still don’t understand exactly what it is or how to make it a part of their baby’s daily routine. I help parents set up tummy time stations throughout the house and walk them through the basics. We talk about how to create a visually stimulating environment and how to encourage a baby to love tummy time and get the most out of it so that their development stays on track. 10:30 a.m.: Baby massage and bath. I love showing new parents how to massage their babies and how to make bath time less stressful. I use a lot of Ayurvedic techniques when teaching massage, and my favorite oil to use is jojoba oil. We go over how to give a safe and enjoyable bath. If there is an older sibling in the house, I love to include them in the baby’s bath time. It’s important to recognize that older siblings go through their own postpartum experience, and they often feel a real sense of loss once the baby comes home. Any time I can encourage siblings to participate in taking care of the baby, it makes them feel like they are still important and still have a special place in the family. 12 p.m.: Lunch/toddler playtime/partner check-in. I try to make sure the parents get a warm, healthy lunch and a break from the baby and older siblings for a bit. I’ll often wear the baby in a baby wrap and get some laundry folded. I might get a crockpot meal started for dinner and prep some snacks for the next day. I’ll take time to read to or play with any older siblings if they’re home — maybe take them outside or do a craft. I also use this time to check in with the mom’s partner to see how they’re doing. Partners experience a lot of change and anxiety during this time, too, and it’s important that they feel heard and taken care of as well. My lunch is usually a quick granola bar or some trail mix. 2-3 p.m.: End of my shift. I make sure that the mom and family are set up for the evening and night. Dinner is planned, hopefully prepped, beds are made, laundry is done and any questions have been answered. We’ve made a referral plan for any lingering concerns. When I leave a family, I want them to feel less anxious and like they’ve really been cared for and nurtured. I feel like I mother the whole family. 4-8 p.m.: Once I get home, my second shift begins. I need to get my teenagers where they need to go for sports and activities. I need to do our laundry and cleaning and figure out what we’re going to eat for dinner. After a hard day of doula work, my ability to caretake often feels completely depleted. Sometimes I feel like I’m a “mother” all day long, and then I have nothing left to mother my own kids. That can be hard. I’ve had to adjust my emotional boundaries with clients over the years so that I don’t burn out. We try to do a sit-down dinner as a family two or three times a week just to check in and see how everyone is doing. 8:30 p.m.: Bedtime. I’m usually in bed by 8:30 or 9. I’ll answer texts from clients and prep for the family I’ll be helping the next day. I like to watch a show or read for a bit — I love a good mystery or memoir, and I’m forever trying to get through my stack of New Yorkers! I’ll also spend time looking at new postpartum products or reading research articles on infant development to share with my clients. I rarely can keep my eyes open past 9.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3GKFMT9,"lifestyleperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
108,2022-02-09,A young Belarusian skier fled the country. Her family says she was banned from the sport for political reasons.," A young Belarusian cross-country skier has fled the country with her family after she was banned from competing internationally, marking the latest prominent athlete to leave Belarus as political repression there deepens. Darya Dolidovich, 17, was blocked from competing in December. She and her family said they believe the ban was connected to her father’s participation in demonstrations against the results of the 2020 election in Belarus, which handed President Alexander Lukashenko another term in a vote widely panned as rigged. The street protests drew tens of thousands of people — including top athletes — in a major challenge to the strongman’s rule, before being violently suppressed. Dolidovich and her family are now in Poland, said her father and coach, seven-time Olympian cross-country skier Sergei Dolidovich. “We left the country, and even though it may have been difficult, it’s easier to breathe now,” he told The Washington Post. Darya Dolidovich was not a contender to compete in the 2022 Beijing Olympics, which kicked off last week. But another Belarusian cross-country skier, Sviatlana Andryiuk, told Reuters last month that she was also blocked from competing internationally. Andryiuk said sports officials accused her of supporting the opposition, even though she said she had never publicly expressed her political views. The move by Belarusian officials forced Andryiuk to miss a qualifying event that could have allowed her to take part in the Beijing Olympics, she told Reuters. She also lost her state job and said she was considering seeking refuge in Poland. The country, which shares a border with Belarus, is becoming a haven for Belarusian dissident athletes. Olympic runner Krystsina Tsimanouskaya sought asylum there after defecting from her home country during the Tokyo Games in August. Tsimanouskaya had criticized Belarusian Olympic officials on social media after they tried to force her to run in a relay for which she had not trained. She said those comments led authorities to attempt to force her home. She refused and sought protection from the Japanese police at Tokyo’s airport in an incident that renewed international condemnation of Lukashenko’s crackdowns. Dolidovich is one of Belarus’s top junior cross-country skiers, according to Reuters, which first reported on her flight to Poland. Her father told The Post that Belarusian sports authorities cited what they described as unsportsmanlike conduct by his daughter. But the two say the real motivation was political. Sergei Dolidovich previously had received reprimands for speaking out against the government. The move is “their way of showing they can do whatever they want,” he said. “There were no threats, but I understood that there is no life for us there — Darya won’t be able to run there, and her career basically ended on Dec. 27.” Pavel Latushka, head of the Belarusian opposition organization National Anti-Crisis Management, said in a statement to The Post that the ban was “absolutely” politically motivated. The International Ski Federation website now lists Darya Dolidovich as “not active” and indicates that she last competed internationally in late December, in Russia. Her father said the family left Belarus without telling anyone and reunited in Warsaw on Monday. They are still figuring out where and how long they will stay. Dolidovich was supposed to finish high school this year. She told Reuters that she was “upset” about having to leave and that she didn’t know how she would complete her studies in Poland. Sergei Dolidovich said he and his daughter still hope Belarusian authorities will lift the ban — but if not, “possibly we will consider changing our citizenship.” International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said at a briefing at the Beijing Games that it was up to the International Ski Federation (FIS) to decide whether to take action in Darya’s case, Reuters reported. “FIS has reached out [to] the Belarus Ski Association for information about the circumstances about the athlete and is still awaiting a reply,” Jenny Wiedeke, a spokeswoman for FIS wrote in a statement to The Post. The Belarus Ski Union did not respond to a request for comment. The Dolidovich family’s decision to leave highlights the climate of repression in which Belarusian athletes live and compete. Other elite athletes and coaches have faced prison time, expulsion from national teams and dismissal from jobs for opposing the government. “Today we see that in many aspects people are de-motivated to sport, interested in and worried about Belarusian athletes,” Latushka said. “On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine the moral state of sportsmen performing on the international scene, when there is a lawlessness in your country, when you can be arrested or criminally punished for any word or post.” During the 2020 protests, security forces detained thousands and subjected hundreds to “torture and other ill-treatment,” according to a Human Rights Watch report. Several people died as a result of police actions. Journalists, activists, rights workers and IT specialists have been jailed since then. Crackdowns have driven many Belarusians into self-imposed exile. Lukashenko, who has ruled the Eastern European country for nearly three decades, has taken increasingly bold steps to quash challenges to his rule. He provoked international outrage in May when he sent a fighter jet to ground a commercial plane carrying a prominent dissident journalist. And European Union officials accused Lukashenko of weaponizing migrants over the summer as relations between the E.U. and Belarus deteriorated. Western countries, including the United States, have imposed tough sanctions on Belarus. But the latter’s close relationship with Russia has cushioned the blow. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s support for Belarus appears to be paying off: Belarus is hosting a massive joint military exercise that began Thursday. The event has heightened fears in the West of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moves against prominent athletes could further cement Belarus’s status as an international pariah. The United States last week imposed visa restrictions on Belarusian nationals “for their involvement in serious, extraterritorial counter-dissident activity,” according to a State Department news release. “The United States condemns all such activity, including the attempt to forcibly repatriate Belarusian Olympian Krystsina Tsimanouskaya during the Tokyo Summer Olympic Games last year,” the statement said. The International Olympic Committee said in September it was investigating two Belarusian coaches accused of trying to force Tsimanouskaya to fly home. That investigation is still ongoing. But the IOC has so far opted not to suspend Belarus’s Olympic committee from participating in the Games. Tsimanouskaya has called for stronger action from international sports authorities.

109,2022-02-09,Abrupt end to mask mandates reflects a shifting political landscape ," As the coronavirus pandemic enters its third year, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is acutely aware that his state’s residents are increasingly desperate for their old lives, worried about their children’s schooling and exasperated by masks and other restrictions. “There’s no question, whether it was last year’s election, whether it was getting a sense of the pulse of the state, people are frustrated. They are fatigued,” Murphy, a Democrat who nearly lost his reelection bid last November, said in an interview. “There’s learning loss in our kids, mental health and stress among kids and adults. Folks are yearning for some sense of normalcy — and count me, by the way, among them.” That’s the backdrop as Murphy, long one of the nation’s most aggressive governors on health restrictions, announced this week that he was lifting New Jersey’s school mask mandate — one of a slew of governors in his party to do so as polls suggest voters are weary of restrictions and last November’s elections highlight Democrats’ vulnerability on the pandemic. State officials say the decisions are driven by data showing that the worst of the omicron surge has passed, but acknowledge they must also weigh a weary public’s tolerance for pandemic life. Even as the Biden administration continues to recommend mask requirements, many of the biggest states led by Democrats are abruptly taking a different tack. California, Oregon, Delaware and Connecticut joined New Jersey in announcing a partial end to mask mandates Monday. The governors of Rhode Island and Massachusetts announced plans Wednesday to end school mask mandates, while the executives of New York and Illinois said they would scrap mask requirements for businesses but are still reviewing schools. Washington announced it would end an outdoor mask mandate and the indoor mask mandate was under review. Several of these Democratic governors have stressed that their constituents need to live with the virus, echoing rhetoric that their Republican counterparts adopted earlier in the pandemic when they declined to take statewide measures to curb the delta and omicron surges. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) said residents now have the tools to keep themselves safe and cautioned that “you are not going to get an all-clear sign.” At a news conference announcing the end to a universal indoor mask mandate Friday, Delaware Gov. John Carney (D) said that “a leader without followers is not very effective leadership, so somehow you have to strike the balance there to keep people following you.” This adds up to a pivotal moment in the politics of the pandemic. From the outset, Democrats urged public health restrictions while Republicans largely rejected them despite the science showing they would save lives. But now — with many Americans vaccinated, the public deeply impatient and the current surge fading — many Democrats are concluding that the time for aggressive statewide measures has passed and are unwilling to risk a further electoral backlash. Some 28 percent of Americans polled by Monmouth University last month said the country would never get the outbreak under control or return to normal, up from 9 percent in March 2021. “The governors are catching up with the realization that the public is moving on this issue,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Polling Institute at Monmouth University. “What we saw with the Murphy decision there, and being joined by other governors there as well, is the recognition that even the folks who were your stalwart supporters at the beginning of the pandemic and stuck with you are starting to question the value of keeping us on high alert.” Support for masks policies has eroded, although it remains high. The same Monmouth poll found that 52 percent of Americans supported face mask and distancing guidelines in their state, down from a peak of 63 percent last September during the delta surge. Still, some vulnerable or elderly Americans remain wary of dropping mask requirements, and covid deaths remain high in many places. The governors who are scrapping their state mask mandates are still allowing localities to keep them in place, signaling that conditions are improving without fully abandoning a key tool to curb transmission. “The feeling that many people are over this and we should just say covid is endemic and be done with it has certainly gathered a lot of steam,” Oregon State Epidemiologist Dean Sidelinger said. “But we have to remember even when we say endemic, that does not mean the end of covid. It means ideally covid is spreading at a level where it’s not impacting daily life in a significant way. And we are just not there now.” Over the last several weeks, Democratic governors and their top aides engaged in conversations about how to exit the emergency phase of the pandemic, according to a person involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private talks. As governors gathered in Washington last month for the National Governors Association’s winter meeting, leaders from both parties pressed President Biden to help them navigate the next phase of the pandemic. As blue states shed mask mandates, the Biden administration continues to proceed cautiously on changing the federal guidance. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday that the guidance is under review, but for now Americans should continue to wear masks indoors in areas of high transmission, which covers much of the country. “We are working on following the trends for the moment,” she said at the White House covid briefing. “What I will say, though, is our hospitalizations are still high. Our death rates are still high. So as we work towards that and as we are encouraged by the current trends, we are not there yet.” Still, the administration has spent the last several weeks consulting health experts to chart a path out of the pandemic, including when and how to ease restrictions. “We’re moving toward a time when covid won’t disrupt our daily lives, a time when covid won’t be a constant crisis, but rather will be something we can protect against and treat,” Jeff Zients, the White House covid coordinator, said Wednesday. But as more Democratic governors move to loosen mask requirements, some administration officials are concerned about mixed messaging. One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly, said the CDC should have been better prepared to avoid confusing Americans who are receiving different guidance from their governors, the White House and possibly local leaders. But inside the White House, officials remain fearful of abandoning restrictions and declaring victory prematurely. Last July, Biden declared that “the virus is on the run” and vowed the country is “closer than ever to declaring our independence from this deadly virus” — only to have the delta and omicron variants send cases skyrocketing. Experts say the country is better equipped now to fight future variants, but the risk remains. Some public health experts worry the recent moves by Democratic governors are premature when previous attempts to relax rules have been followed by a surge. “There are tremendous pressures upon all politicians to reduce precautions that are in place, because everyone is really tired after two years of coping with this pandemic,” said Stanley Weiss, an epidemiologist at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “The history of what’s happened in this pandemic is people relaxing their precautions because they think we’re over the hump, and that helps contribute to the resurgence.” Others say public health authorities should be mindful of pandemic fatigue, especially to preserve their credibility if a variant even more contagious or deadlier than omicron emerges. “These are tools that should be used thoughtfully, in part because if you don’t use them thoughtfully, people will begin not to follow them and not listen next time you say, ‘It’s time to get serious again, folks,’ ” said Robert M. Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is expected to announce in coming days whether he will extend the state’s school mask mandate, which is set to expire Tuesday. His administration announced Monday that it would lift an indoor mask requirement at businesses and other settings for the vaccinated, reverting to pre-omicron rules that still require the unvaccinated to mask up. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, said the rules are being relaxed because with hospitalizations down, the health-care system no longer faces a dire threat. Public health authorities owe it to a tired public to pull back restrictions when conditions improve, he added. “All of us have been impacted by this and are exhausted in one way or the other, and it’s important state leaders and local leaders pay attention to that level of exhaustion,” Ghaly said. “When we say we are constantly assessing, we are actually constantly assessing. That’s not lip service.” Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, commended the recent moves to roll back mask mandates. He said he is advising Democratic lawmakers and candidates to emphasize that the party has been the “responsible” one in battling the pandemic but that Democrats should avoid being “preachy.” “The frustrations are real and should not be taken lightly,” Maloney said. “But the key is that the risks are now lower.” Scott D. Clement, Brittany Shammas and Emily Guskin contributed to this report.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3oDBhno,health
110,2022-02-09,Auto industry already feeling the pinch from Canadian bridge blockade," Rob Wildeboer may have to decide as soon as Thursday whether the Canadian trucker protest that is blocking a key bridge between the United States and Canada will require him to furlough some of his several thousand factory workers. Wildeboer, 62, the chairman of Martinrea International, which produces components for every global automaker, said Wednesday that the protests are within hours of halting some of his production lines. The company’s engine blocks, transmissions, subframes and brake lines can be found in GM Sierra pickup trucks, Ford Escapes and Jeep Grand Cherokees. Each day, Wildeboer’s trucks make 38 trips across the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, shuttling half-finished products between company plants in both countries. The shipments are just part of $300 million in daily commerce that transits the aging steel span and is imperiled by the traffic-snarling protest of Canada’s coronavirus restrictions and vaccine mandates. For the auto industry, the borders between the United States, Canada and Mexico were effectively erased nearly 30 years ago by a North American trade deal. The industry has developed since then into a tightly choreographed industrial ballet that relies on parts arriving at a factory just in time to be used. “We make a part Monday morning, it’s probably on a vehicle by Wednesday,” Wildeboer said. The partial blockade of the Ambassador Bridge, now in its third day, threatens to derail the normal handoff from one factory to the next. A lengthy impasse, like the original “Freedom Convoy” that has jammed the streets of Ottawa for 11 days, would be likely to send layoffs rippling through factories in both countries. Already, Ford said it had stopped making new truck engines at a facility in Windsor and reduced output of Edge sedans at its Oakville assembly plant outside Toronto. Stellantis said it interrupted production at its Ontario plant. “The Windsor Assembly Plant had to cut short its first and second shifts on Tuesday due to parts shortages,” Stellantis said in a statement on Wednesday. “The plant resumed production this morning. We continue to work closely with our carriers to get parts into the plant to mitigate further disruptions.” Toyota said Wednesday that it was facing “shortages affecting production at our North American plants,” including in Canada, but the Japanese automaker said it did not “anticipate any impact to employment at this time.” Magna International, an Aurora, Ontario-based supplier of vehicle components including chassis and seats, said it had shifted some of its shipments to alternative border crossings because of the bridge obstruction. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said administration officials were working with their Canadian counterparts and industry executives to ease the damage to the auto industry, U.S. agricultural exports and the flow of workers between the United States and Canada. “We’re very focused on this. The president is very focused on this,” Psaki said. At the Ambassador Bridge, one lane across the Detroit River remained open on Wednesday, permitting limited traffic to trickle into the United States. Trucks bound for Canada are being rerouted to the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia, Ontario, about 60 miles away. Given the crush of vehicles and resulting delays in Sarnia, the longer route is adding three hours to the trucks’ customary journey, Wildeboer said. Martinrea is a “Tier 1” industry parts maker, meaning it directly supplies giants such as GM, Daimler, Bentley and Honda. Headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario, the company has almost 16,000 employees, including about 5,000 production workers in the United States and 2,500 in Canada. Martinrea plants can be found in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Missouri. If normal commercial flows are not restored quickly, some Martinrea operations will be forced to halt, Wildeboer said. Three of the company’s facilities near London, Ontario, will be among the first to feel the blockade’s effects. “We make big stuff,” Wildeboer said. “We can’t keep production going and have stuff piled up in our yards. The yard would be full in a day and a half.” Nearly two years into a pandemic that has upended normal life, Wildeboer is sympathetic to protesters’ frustration over the Canadian government’s requirement that truckers be vaccinated. If it were up to him, he would scrap the mandate, since 90 percent of Canada’s truckers have already been vaccinated, and the rest could easily be assigned to domestic routes. But his sympathy ends where the economy-strangling blockade begins. The mushrooming protest started with hundreds of tractor-trailers jamming the streets of Ottawa and sounding their air horns, before spreading to Windsor. The Ontario Trucking Association issued a statement disavowing the protests and insisting “most protesters have no connection to the trucking industry.” Likewise, Canadian press reports from the Ambassador Bridge said big rigs there are outnumbered by pickup trucks and sedans, suggesting many protesters come from other segments of society. Automakers already are struggling to supply dealers with enough vehicles to keep pace with surging consumer demand. The bridge protest only complicates those efforts. On Wednesday, the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, which represents major producers including the local arms of Ford, GM and Stellantis, urged an end to the blockades by truckers and their supporters. During the pandemic, the auto industry has endured a roller coaster of plant closures, the worst sales slump since the 2008 financial crisis, an unanticipated recovery and surprising shortfalls of computer chips needed in modern vehicles. Martinrea has struggled more than most. The company’s share price is down almost 31 percent over the past year, nearly three times the decline in a Standard & Poor’s auto industry index. The company lost $13.5 million in the third quarter last year after making a $34.4 million profit in the same period one year earlier. Briefing investors on the financial performance, Wildeboer offered a blunt verdict: “Q3 kind of sucked.” Although conditions improved in the last three months of the year, new supply headaches are constantly emerging. Last week, one of Wildeboer’s customers managed to secure the computer chips it needed but was forced to shut down for three days anyway because it couldn’t obtain enough vehicle headlights, Wildeboer said. His U.S. plants are battling the same labor shortfall that afflicts other employers. European facilities are being hammered by high energy costs. Supplies of resin, used in injection-molded plastic parts, also remain scarce. “We’re kind of used to getting punched in the face,” Wildeboer said, adding that he is “medium optimistic” about prospects for finding an early resolution to the impasse at the bridge.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3gyXmii,economy
111,2022-02-09,"Dealt a bad hand, Democrats are poised to make it worse"," Before my wife popped into a convenience store on Monday to grab a soda, she put on a mask. That is the rule in New York state, after all: masks to be worn indoors even when vaccinated. She’d probably have worn a mask anyway, with an unvaccinated kid at home, cases in our area still high and test positivity at 10 percent. As she put it on, a man leaving the store mocked her. “Gotta get that mask on!” he said — while not wearing a mask, of course. There was a brief, condescending exchange that culminated with my wife responding using language that the editors of The Post would ask I not include in this article. It’s a useful incident to consider when reflecting on how the debate over containing the coronavirus has progressed. The man was not adhering to the state mandate, but, as of Thursday, there will be no mandate to which he needs to adhere. New York, like a number of other blue states, is rescinding its state-level mask guidance. Here, the mandate was implemented at the outset of the omicron variant surge. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy (D) went further, announcing an end to masking in schools at the end of the month. Murphy and fellow Democrats like Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.) are linking the shifts to the decline in cases after the spike that accompanied the emergence of the omicron variant. But they’re also acknowledging in the news media that the changes in policy are driven by the broad, bipartisan exhaustion with the pandemic. The New York Times reported that Murphy conducted focus groups measuring that frustration and that his decision to rescind mask mandates for schools was linked to that frustration. This is politics, of course, and the will of the voters is important to track. But allowing the impression to set that politics is the central driver for the change — an impression that’s hard to avoid at this point — Democratic leaders are both undercutting their ability to respond to the pandemic moving forward and undercutting two years of rhetoric. Consider six blue areas that either implemented statewide mask mandates as omicron emerged or that recently announced plans to scale back mask-wearing. We’re focused on cases here and not deaths because cases precede death totals by several weeks (for obvious reasons) and because mask-wearing effectively targets infection at the front end. Two things stand out. First, that the trajectory of new cases in places that implemented new mandates certainly does suggest that the need for such mandates has diminished. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thinks it’s too early and one could certainly wonder if this isn’t an example of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s famous line about rolling back voting rights: It’s like “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” Maybe the masks were the reason those cases had dropped. Except that we then come to the second thing that stands out: The case surge and recession was about the same in states that did and didn’t implement a mandate. Murphy didn’t implement a new statewide mask mandate, and the per capita case count in New Jersey was about the same as the one in New York, which did. The reason for this seems obvious and is illustrated by that anecdote with my wife. Americans will, by now, largely do what they want to do in containing the virus: Mandates likely helped spur more people to wear masks than otherwise would; people whose opposition would prompt them to grumble but not go so far as to record themselves yelling at the Home Depot clerk in the hopes they’d go viral on Rumble. But just as many Americans won’t get vaccinated, many won’t wear masks or scale back large gatherings, even as cases in an area increase.  This has been the complicating factor for the government’s response for more than a year, and one that has overlapped with partisan politics. Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis simply threw up their hands at trying to encourage mask-wearing and vaccination months ago, but now Democratic governors seem to be increasingly willing to adopt that same position. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) summarized this increasingly common attitude in December: “You don’t tell people what to wear. You don’t tell people to wear a jacket when they go out in winter and force them to. If they get frostbite, it’s their own darn fault.” He did not implement a mask mandate when omicron spiked in his state. It’s easy to see how this poses a potential future challenge. Revoking a mandate while expressing cautious optimism that one won’t be needed in the future is very different than revoking a mandate and declaring victory. What happens if this fall a new variant emerges that has a high mortality rate but can be well-contained by a cloth mask? Would Murphy and Polis not mandate mask-wearing? Again, this is the DeSantis bet: Keep your head down and hope things don’t get too bad. (Or spin it if it does.) The Democratic Party and President Biden  for two years have argued that they are the party of following the science. A narrative about giving up containment efforts due to political pressure severely undercuts that argument. Consider the confidence in the roots of decision-making by health officials that was captured in a Pew Research Center poll released on Wednesday. When guidance changed, most Democrats saw it as a reflection of increased understanding and new research. Republicans viewed the changes with skepticism. If the guidance is being influenced primarily by politics, which of the above perspectives is reinforced? It’s also worth noting, as journalist James Surowiecki did on Twitter, that some of the changes being advocated (like Murphy’s decision to end mask-wearing in schools) aren’t dependent on clear scientific analysis. As is the case with many other aspects of the virus, the research on the effects of mask-wearing for kids isn’t clear. There are certainly strong opinions on it, with parents on both the left and the right organizing in defense of their positions, but this shouldn’t be the driver of a state’s response. The Republican Party sees CDC guidance on masks in schools as a political hit on Democrats. So, it seems, does Murphy. The good news is that much of American life is approaching something like normal. Many employers still mandate masks, and there are still frustrating rules around possible exposure that are upending workplaces and schools. Both of those should presumably loosen as omicron cases recede and, hopefully, remain low. So the danger for Democratic governors is not in pulling back containment measures; it’s in pulling them back predicated on the pandemic being effectively over instead of as a step toward normalcy. It not only undercuts the ability to reintroduce recommendations or mandates in the future, it also undercuts the rationale for doing so, the trust Democrats (at least) have that decisions are being made based on consideration of the available evidence. And it’s just strange: If mask mandates are revoked, how much complaint will there be if it’s accompanied with a “but we’re watching to see what happens”? The political reality is that the past year of the pandemic has largely been shaped by the minority of Americans who object to taking any precautions against the virus (including that subset who, like the guy at that convenience store, take it upon themselves to try to enforce their own conformity on others). Democratic governors could recognize that reality without acquiescing to that approach. By not doing so, they’re weakening, not improving their political position.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3BefCY6,"politicsanalysiscloseanalysis interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events"
112,2022-02-09,How to avoid a costly isolation period if you get coronavirus while abroad," Maybe you’ve seen the stories about coronavirus-positive travelers getting trapped in third-rate, government-approved isolation hotels or in cruise ship “red zones” with tiny cabins and substandard food. And maybe you’ve wondered whether there’s a way to avoid an involuntary confinement if you test positive for the coronavirus on vacation. There is — to a point. “If you test positive for covid in a foreign land, you don’t have many choices,” says Rajeev Shrivastava, CEO of VisitorsCoverage, a travel insurance marketplace. “Most commercial flights will not board passengers who can’t provide a valid negative test for covid.” But you can avoid a costly isolation. Doing so requires careful planning, buying adequate insurance and having a solid backup plan, just in case your trip goes sideways. As the coronavirus slowly loosens its grip on the world and Americans begin to plan more international trips, they’re more likely to need these strategies. Buying standard travel insurance or a medical evacuation plan may be the best way to avoid an unpleasant or unwanted confinement. Carolyn Paddock, a travel adviser and founder of In-Flight Insider, has been recommending Covac Global or MedjetAssist to her clients lately. She recently told clients headed to St. Lucia about these policies, which cover medical evacuations in case you fall ill while you’re abroad, and they took her advice. “With that coverage, they had peace of mind that they would most likely be able to depart St. Lucia if they tested positive,” Paddock says. Note that she said “most likely.” Both types of coverage have important limitations and don’t work in every country. As always, experts say you should read the fine print. And don’t forget standard travel insurance. Geoffrey Millstone, a travel adviser with Clarksburg Travel Service, a travel agency in Clarksburg, W.Va., has had two clients test positive on vacation recently. Between their travel insurance and the coronavirus policies at their respective hotels, they had no additional expenses.  One client on vacation at the Excellence Playa Mujeres in Cancún, Mexico, tested positive for the coronavirus. The resort provided accommodations, food and nonalcoholic drinks for his eight nights of isolation, and insurance covered his airline ticket charges, Millstone says. A second client tested positive at the Riu Palace Tropical Bay in Negril, Jamaica. Her partner did not get sick. “The hotel allowed both to stay, upgraded them to an oceanfront room and fed them with excellent room-service menus,” he recalls. Without insurance, they might have had to pay for 10 extra nights of isolation, plus meals and laundry expenses. Virtually all major travel insurance companies cover trips disrupted because of the coronavirus, but you’ll want to read the fine print carefully. If you’re traveling somewhere expensive, you’ll want at least $5,000 worth of coverage to pay your extra hotel bills. Planning ahead can also help you avoid an unnecessary confinement in substandard accommodations. When I visited Abu Dhabi recently, I learned that the government had designated several properties as official isolation hotels. The hotels are locked down tight, with only infected guests allowed in and out. When my son got infected, I also learned that all hotels are obligated to keep you if you test positive; they can’t just kick you out and tell you to fend for yourself. So a hotel like this may not be your only option when you fail a coronavirus test. Some hotels set aside an entire floor for infected patients. They’re typically low-key about it and offer reduced-rate rooms with room service and laundry services at a reasonable price. When I visited Qatar earlier this year, I found that Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health published a list of approved quarantine hotels online. A skilled travel planner can ensure that you’re booked in a hotel that accepts infected travelers or is designated as a quarantine hotel. If you’re planning your trip on your own, you’ll need to do some research. If you book through a site such as Hotels.com, for example, you can find information about quarantine hotels in the listings. The site’s messaging feature also offers a direct link with the hotel, so you can ask about these facilities. To avoid an unpleasant confinement, create an airtight plan in case you get infected. Tim Hentschel, CEO of HotelPlanner, says the State Department’s resources should be part of any Plan B. He recommends signing up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, which lets the U.S. government know your whereabouts. “Also, research the covid protocols on your destination country’s government websites, and sign up for email alerts to monitor changes,” he advises. Many of the experts I spoke to recommend carrying a self-test. That way, if you think you might be sick, you can test yourself right away and exercise your backup plan.  If you have insurance that includes a medical evacuation, self-isolate immediately and call the company to ask about next steps. Let its medical experts guide you. Remember: Once hotel or cruise ship staff members find out you’re infected, they must follow a strict protocol. And those rules might land you in a government-run hotel or a lower-deck inside cabin, without any hope of getting out until you’ve completed your isolation. It takes a little extra effort and planning to implement these strategies, but that’s the burden of traveling during a pandemic. PLEASE NOTE Potential travelers should take local and national public health directives regarding the pandemic into consideration before planning any trips.

113,2022-02-09,How to get the NFL mad about calling the Super Bowl ‘the Super Bowl’," Americans make too much of the Super Bowl. I know this seems intentionally contrarian, and, to some extent, it is. But we do. We spend all of this time talking about it and everybody watches it and we have parties and all that. On rare occasions, it’s a good game. Often, it’s not. At some point, someone figured out that an effective way to offset this tepidity was to have interesting ads run in the breaks, so that became a thing. By now, though, it’s mostly the same stuff: Budweiser doing 14 versions of a wacky thing, a heartfelt spot about family from someone like Target that runs three times in the fourth quarter, a spot from Google that cleanly blends primary colors with reflecting cellphones. That you can visualize all of those immediately upon reading the sentence proves the point. This year, we get all of that plus the Cincinnati Bengals. Anyone who says they are enthusiastic about it is flat-out lying. There is, however, a hackneyed aspect of the Super Bowl that I’ve always found interesting: the NFL’s hyperactive protection of the term “Super Bowl” itself. This game makes everyone involved an outrageous amount of money, and so the league runs a Stasi-level policing effort to ensure that the people who are allowed to use “Super Bowl” are the only people who use “Super Bowl.” In 2007, that meant hollering at a church that was trying to raise money by hosting a watch party for the game. An NFL spokesman told CBS News that this wasn’t a big deal and that the league actually yelled at churches all the time. “They say ‘Thanks’ and they have their Super Bowl viewing parties within the rules,” he explained. All a house of worship has to do is follow the rules set by the NFL and it is fine. What’s the big deal? Many people did not see this as not a big deal, so the NFL later changed its policy somewhat. In the years since, trademark lawyer Mitchell Stabbe wrote in his annual explanation of how to avoid irritating the league, “the NFL has said that it will not object to a church viewing party for the Super Bowl if it is held in the church’s usual place of worship and no fee is charged for attending.” So that’s nice. I reached out to Stabbe because I was exploring a story about what sort of pitch I might make on social media that would trigger a cease-and-desist response from the NFL. In addition to the other things I find annoying about the Super Bowl, I find it annoying that I have to see ads from local supermarkets trying to sell me potato chips to eat while I watch “the Big Game,” which is how everyone talks about the Super Bowl without talking about the Super Bowl. A Voldemortian that-which-shall-not-be-named — unless you lay out massive amounts of money. So I threw scenarios at Stabbe. With the first, I asked what might happen if I tweeted a link to The Washingotn Post’s subscription page with the lure, “Buy The Washington Post the day after the Super Bowl to see the score.” And his unsatisfying answer was: nothing. “The First Amendment creates wider latitude for the use of third-party trademarks because it’s communicative or expressive speech rather than commercial speech,” he said, speaking within the context of my pitch for the paper. “Now the fact that The Washington Post ostensibly is out to make a profit doesn’t mean that it’s commercial as opposed to communicative. That’s not the test of commercial. Commercial means you’re just proposing a transaction. You’re trying to sell something. So newspapers and other media have pretty wide latitude in how they can use third-party trademarks because they’re protected by the First Amendment.” I amended my proposal. What if, instead, I tried to sell a TV cabinet on Facebook (as though people don’t wall-mount televisions these days, but you get the point), and pitched it as perfect for watching the Super Bowl? Again, Stabbe was skeptical that the NFL would care. “The real question still is whether or not that’s trademark infringement or what’s called ‘nominative fair use,’ ” he said. “You can use someone else’s trademark to refer to them when there’s basically no other way to refer to them and it’s not misleading; [when] it’s clear you’re talking about the third party, you’re not trying to brand yourself. So to me? In my humble opinion? If you bury Super Bowl in the middle of a declarative sentence, and you don’t draw attention to it, that’s not trademark infringement.” He added an important caveat: The NFL might not agree. The NFL might think I was trying to leverage its “good will” to sell my product, which — fair, I was. This is key: The boundaries of the law are not necessarily what guides the NFL’s response; instead, the whims and will of the NFL guide it. Stabbe could explain what response he might expect, but he certainly couldn’t anticipate where and how the NFL might deploy its police force. (A spokesperson for the NFL did not follow up on my request for an interview.) “The test in trademark law is, is it likely to create consumer confusion?” he explained. “But trademark owners can be aggressive.” Stabbe offered the example of Best Buy selling its television cabinets with a circular emphasizing the words “Super Bowl.” “The NFL’s point of view is, if we are licensing Walmart to be our exclusive partner for the Super Bowl, they’re not going to be happy if Best Buy can run this ad.” It is, of course, useful for the NFL that this perception of overzealousness exists. “Does the NFL sue that often? No,” Stabbe pointed out. “But who wants to run that risk?” Those churches that acquiesced to the NFL’s rules weren’t doing so because they appreciated the league’s viewpoint on whether they could have three dozen people come watch the game. Their saying “thanks” was saying “thank you for not suing us into oblivion, which you could do, because you have 22.8 gazillion dollars.” At its heart, the question is money. If the NFL thinks that your use of “Super Bowl” infringes on the financial agreements it has in place or on its potential to affect future lucrative agreements, you will have a process server on your doorstep before you finish typing “SUPER.” The word “thinks” is the crux of that sentence; as noted, the league takes an expansive view of this. Churches charging a fundraising fee for a Super Bowl party, for example, is a slippery slope toward … uh … something that affects the bottom line, apparently. Someone filing for a trademark for a charity bowling event — “Superbowling Spectacular” — faced opposition from the league because step one is you raise money for nonprofits with a bowl-a-thon, step two is [??], and step three is the NFL goes bankrupt. It’s almost too obvious. Finally, I cut to the chase. What Stabbe was saying was that I, in my capacity as a guy simply trying to goad the NFL into being annoyed, would be hard pressed to gin up a scenario in which that would happen. So I asked him that if he were advising a small-business owner about how to craft a sales pitch around the Super Bowl, what they should do. He offered some thoughts about the purposes of trademark law, specifically to “protect consumers from confusion as to affiliation or approval” and to “protect the goodwill that the trademark owners built up” in their use of the mark. But his answer for how a business could be careful was succinct. “Use ‘the big game,’ ” he said. Once again, the Super Bowl gets less fun.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3B7AKiB,"politicsanalysiscloseanalysis interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events"
114,2022-02-09,I tell doctors I don’t want to know what I weigh. It’s a small step toward freedom.," The nursing assistant asks me to step on the scale. I do but quickly avert my eyes. I mumble something about not wanting to know my weight, saying that it has never done me any good. I over-explain and self-deprecate. It’s awkward for both of us, but when I walk away, I don’t know how much I weigh. That is no small mercy. For years, I knew exactly how much I weighed. It was something I checked, with the holiness of ritual, first thing in the morning before dutifully logging the numbers into my fitness-tracking app. I would watch the graph slope upward or downward. And whatever the numbers said on the scale changed how I saw myself that day — and how I treated my body as it moved me through the world. As a chronically ill person, I am constantly in and out of doctor’s offices, which also means I’m often stepping on scales. Anyone with body image issues can tell you how dreaded the doctor’s scale is — we tell ourselves it adds weight, that our shoes and clothes are on, that it isn’t calibrated the same way as the one at home. But for me, and so many other women, it doesn’t matter how we try to explain away the number on the doctor’s scale — it still holds us by the throat, pressing on old bruises that don’t need the ache. It took me more than two decades of dreading the prospect of being weighed to start making a request to not know. But others are doing it more and more, and for some women, it started much earlier. Baeley Hathaway’s mother realized that her daughter was hyper-focused on her body at a young age. So, starting when Hathaway was 7, her mother told her to turn backward on the scale at the doctor’s office, she says. Looking back, Hathway says, she’s glad her mother taught her to advocate for herself back then. But it also makes her deeply sad to know that she has struggled with body image issues since she was a child, she says. Now a 24-year-old who lives in Idaho, Hathaway says she has accepted that she will always have some kind of body image or eating issue. But she is still able to help control the descent into calorie counting and obsessive food tracking, she says, by looking away from the scale. Sophie Vershbow, a 32-year-old from New York, says she has struggled with anorexia and bulimia since her late teens. Knowing her exact weight can trigger disordered thoughts, so she doesn’t keep a scale in her apartment and closes her eyes when she’s weighed at an appointment. “Part of decoupling myself from disordered behavior meant giving up the control of monitoring my weight, and stepping on a scale can immediately take me back to that head space,” she says. In the beginning of her recovery, Vershbow felt mortified when asking health-care practitioners not to mention her weight. But now, Vershbow says, she simply repeats this refrain as she closes her eyes: “Please don’t tell me what the scale reads; I don’t weigh myself.” Sometimes that request is honored easily, Vershbow says. Sometimes she is asked why she doesn’t want to know her weight. And sometimes, despite the fact that her medical chart details years of eating disorders, a doctor walks in and immediately mentions her weight, she says. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders estimates that 9 percent of the U.S. population will experience an eating disorder in their lifetime, but many patients say their medical provider lack knowledge with how to best handle situations like this. Kristine Cooley, an advanced practice registered nurse based in Florida, says that sometimes weight is necessary for providers to know. It affects how certain medications, such as birth control or anesthesia, are prescribed to a patient, for example. But, Cooley says, it is important to acknowledge that knowing a patient’s weight can add prejudice in medical settings. Studies show that anti-fat bias contributes to poorer care and worse outcomes for people of size. And weight bias can make patients lose trust in their providers and avoid the doctor’s office altogether. As a health-care worker, Cooley says, she believes in health at every size. “Anyone at any size body deserves complete access to compassionate care,” she says. “I encourage people in all size bodies to ask, ‘What is the purpose of me being weighed right now?’” There are even cards you can order to hand to health-care providers that say, “Please don’t weigh me unless it’s really medically necessary.” Ivy Felicia, a body relationship coach whose business is based in Maryland, says she has a “weight neutral” perspective on life. “I don’t focus on the scale or my weight or inches or body size,” Felicia says. “I don’t define myself by my weight.” Part of healing her relationship with her body after an eating disorder has been decentering the scale from her life, she adds. She consents to being weighed at doctor’s appointments but asks not to be told the number. As a Black woman, it can be particularly difficult to have that conversation, Felicia says. “Historically, [Black women] have not been given body autonomy, so when we ask for that, there’s a lot of resistance in the medical community,” she says. “There are assumptions that Black women, especially Black women of size, don’t know what’s best for our bodies.” Felicia urges anyone who is looking to lessen the importance of the scale to push past that initial discomfort and ask for what they need: to not know their weight. In not knowing, Felicia says, there can be a release of defining your body by external beauty standards. I dream of the day I feel neutral about my weight. Even now, as I look away from scales and toss after-visit printouts in the trash, my weight is on my mind. Sometimes I wonder how much time I have spent thinking about the size of my body and willing it to be smaller. I know it is a waste of time, and still, I cannot stop. I don’t think body positivity is in the cards for me, but weight neutrality seems like something I could reach toward. And when I ask not to be told my weight — even if I do it awkwardly and through stammers and ill-timed jokes — I am reaching toward weight neutrality, toward a better, more forgiving relationship with my body, toward freedom. I’m going to keep reaching, even if I haven’t grabbed onto anything yet.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3Lvkixc,"lifestyleperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
115,2022-02-09,Mask mandates continue to fall as Fauci says U.S. may be approaching ‘normality’," Mask mandates continued to fall in traditionally cautious blue states Wednesday as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases plunged, covid-19 hospitalizations dropped below 100,000 and the government’s chief medical adviser, Anthony S. Fauci, said the country is “on the road to approaching normality.” In New York, Illinois and Rhode Island, governors said they would soon end requirements that adults wear face coverings in public indoor places and some, including Massachusetts, promised children would no longer have to wear them in school. “This is what we’ve been waiting for — tremendous progress after two long years,” said Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) of New York, where the mask mandate will expire Thursday, but the school requirement will remain until at least early March. “And we’re not done. But this is trending in a very, very good direction, and that is why we are now approaching a new phase in this pandemic.” But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and some independent experts remained more wary. They tried to slow the gathering momentum to move on from a crisis that has killed more than 900,000 people in the United States and disrupted life around the globe for more than two years. “We continue to recommend masking in areas of high and substantial transmission,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing on the pandemic, where she noted the seven-day average of new infections, while plummeting, is still more than 247,000 each day. “That’s much of the country right now, in public indoor settings.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Americans living in states that have pulled back their mask mandates should still follow CDC guidelines. Taken together, Wednesday’s events were another unusual moment in the once-in-a-century public health crisis: A weary public and eager elected officials largely ignoring the advice of the health professionals who had guided them to this point. California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Delaware also have dropped mask mandates in recent days. In some cases, officials said local authorities would be making future decisions on when to mask. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while responsibility for the data rests with the CDC, decisions about mitigation methods involve other considerations. “The risks and benefits of a mask mandate is not a science,” she said. “There is a data and strategy element, and a political element.” A poll released by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday showed that 60 percent of the public has been confused by changes in public health recommendations about how to slow the coronavirus, seven points more than last summer. “It’s hard because there is definitely uncertainty,” said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “People are responding to uncertainty in different ways.” Some people have wanted to shed masks — or refused to wear them — since the pandemic began. But unlike the ebb of four previous surges that offered false hopes of an end to the pandemic, this decline features full vaccination for 64 percent of the U.S. population, acquired immunity for millions who have contracted the virus and therapies that can prevent serious illness, experts said. That has contributed to the surge in optimism. “I’m glad because guess what? I’m not a cop. I’m not a politician. I’m not a scientist. And I’m not a health inspector. But I’ve had to be all those things in this pandemic,” said Mark Strausman, 65, a chef at Mark’s Off Madison in New York City, as he made pastries. “Now I can go back to my business. “Look, I think of the pandemic like terrorism. It never totally goes away, but at a certain point you have to live your life.” The omicron variant itself has proved to cause milder disease than previous versions of the virus — except among the unvaccinated, the elderly and the medically vulnerable. On Wednesday states reported a seven-day average of 2,564 deaths, a slight decline but still more than at any time since vaccines became widely available. And the ever-present threat of another variant emerging prompted warnings that public health measures such as mask mandates certainly were not yet gone forever. “Everything I am saying is based on a big caveat,” Fauci said in an interview. “We must be prepared for the eventuality that we might get a completely different variant that breaks through all of the protection that you get from prior infection.” Some agreed. “It’s too soon and clearly politically motivated. They’re catering to everyone who is fatigued and frustrated. It’s not science and, frankly, it’s not comforting,” said Xavier Smith, 38, a singer heading to Joe’s Pub in New York City, which requires proof of boosters for customers. “There’s a tendency to stop the control program before the disease is controlled,” said William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “Hang in there with us for another month or two, and then let’s transition from pandemic to endemic in a careful way.” Amid the loosening restrictions in the United States, the world on Wednesday marked 500,000 deaths from the highly contagious omicron variant, which was detected in November. About 100,000 of those were in the United States. The World Health Organization’s incident manager, Abdi Mahamud, called the death toll “tragic” in an online Q&A session in light of the availability of “effective vaccines.” He said there have been 130 million reported cases of the coronavirus globally since omicron was identified. Worldwide, coronavirus deaths rose for the fifth consecutive week, with the 68,000 fatalities reported last week representing a 7 percent jump from the previous week. Last week, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news briefing that covid deaths are increasing in many parts of the world. He warned it would be “premature for any country either to surrender, or to declare victory” against the coronavirus. “We’re concerned that a narrative has taken hold in some countries that because of vaccines, and because of omicron’s high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible, and no longer necessary,” he said. “Nothing could be further from the truth.” Denmark started a trend when it announced in late January that it would end most coronavirus restrictions and attempt to forge a path out of the pandemic that other highly vaccinated countries can follow. “We say goodbye to the restrictions and welcome the life we knew before” the pandemic, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at the time. “As of Feb. 1, Denmark will be open.” Other European countries have followed — though not all on the same schedule — and set off a furious debate among public health experts about whether it is too soon to let down their guard. Starting Wednesday, Sweden began “phasing out” restrictions, notably by eliminating limits on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the requirement to show proof of vaccination to attend events. Spain and Italy announced an end to their outdoor mask mandates this week, after France did the same last week. Beginning Friday, all testing requirements to enter the United Kingdom will be scrapped for vaccinated travelers. The governments of these countries reason that now is the time to ease or eliminate restrictions because, while the omicron variant is keeping case numbers high in Europe, hospitalizations have been manageable, and a majority of their populations are vaccinated. The “live with it” strategy has divided public health experts: Some cheer the return to a more normal life after more than two years of restrictions, and others say the easing of rules will send a false signal that omicron is nothing to worry about. One cause for concern is the vast disparity within Europe in vaccination coverage and national health-care systems’ capacity to handle case surges. The Balkans and Eastern and Central European countries are generally less vaccinated. Cyprus, Armenia and Slovenia have on average recorded some of the largest jumps in daily covid-19 deaths in the world over the past week, according to a Washington Post tracker.

116,2022-02-09,"No, the federal government isn’t spending $30 million on ‘crack pipes’"," Conservative figures have launched an online furor this week, claiming that the government planned to spend $30 million on pipes for smoking crack cocaine. The heightened concern came months after the Department of Health and Human Services announced a federal grant for local programs that provide myriad “harm reduction” tools, or services that minimize the risks associated with drug use, including distributing drug paraphernalia such as clean needles. Republicans seized on “crack pipes,” causing the phrase to trend on Twitter on Tuesday, the latest in continued resistance from the GOP against harm-reduction techniques at a time when people are dying of drug overdoses at record rates in the United States. “It’s really disappointing that Republicans are trying to win political points by putting lives at risk and creating misinformation about harm reduction,” said Jamie Favaro, executive director of NEXT Distro, one of the groups that applied for the grants. If given the funds, NEXT Distro would spend funds to distribute the overdose-reversing drug naloxone and clean syringes in Georgia, Louisiana and Nevada. Amid mounting outrage fueled in part by Fox News and other conservative outlets, here’s what to know about the federal grant: In a first-of-its-kind federal grant to be distributed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a branch of HHS, dozens of organizations across the country would be able to spend the money over three years on a preapproved list of resources, including referrals to treatment, infectious-disease testing kits, condoms, and vaccinations for hepatitis A and B. Also on the list: “safe smoking kits.” Typically, such kits include a rubber mouthpiece to prevent cuts and burns, brass screens to filter contaminants and disinfectant wipes, according to Harm Reduction International. Favaro, whose program does not distribute the “safe smoking kits” approved by HHS, said groups that provide kits typically don’t include a glass pipe as it is expensive relative to providing the rubber mouthpiece. Clean glass pipes are intended to curb sharing pipes and spreading oral infections or injecting with needles, a riskier method of doing drugs. Keith Humphreys, an addiction researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, said researchers haven’t found that providing glass pipes works as intended, in part because of the difficulty of tracking infectious diseases spreading among drug users. But addiction, like other health problems, requires solutions beyond cures to reduce suffering, he said. “Obviously, we would like everybody who is addicted to never use drugs again, but if we can’t have that, we should be grateful to at least reduce use or reduce the damage of use to that person or to the people around them,” he said. On Wednesday, the White House and HHS denied the funds would be spent on the pipes. HHS did not answer a question from The Washington Post about whether the kits could include glass stems. “HHS and ONDCP are focused on using our resources smartly to reduce harm and save lives. Accordingly, no federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Rahul Gupta said in a statement. “The goal of harm reduction is to save lives.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki also on Wednesday dismissed a report as “inaccurate” from the conservative outlet Washington Free Beacon that an HHS spokesperson said the White House would be distributing crack pipes. “We wanted to put out information to make that clear,” Psaki said. “The safe smoking kit may contain alcohol swabs, lip balm, other materials to promote hygiene and reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis.” The funding is “a historic moment” in drug policy as most harm reduction programs have been otherwise ineligible for federal funding in years past, according to Sheila Vakharia, an expert at the Drug Policy Alliance. These groups, often at the front line in communities hit hardest by the latest waves of the overdose epidemic, directly service people who use drugs, deploying “the law of attraction” to get people otherwise marginalized or unable to access health-care resources, such as information about treatment, Vakharia said, a necessity when people who use drugs are often stigmatized. “Harm reduction as a practice and as a philosophy is all about helping people make informed and safer decisions,” Vakharia said. “It’s about saying, ‘This is a place where we accept you for who you are and here are the tools for you to help stay safe while you’re smoking, and in addition, we’ve got condoms, and we can teach you about identifying someone overdosing, and here’s naloxone.’ ” “Biden crime policy: Crack pipes for all. What could go wrong?” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) tweeted. Republican lawmakers and online talking heads painted an absurd image of government-issued crack pipes being mailed to each American like coronavirus tests, alleging that language that said the money would be awarded to underserved communities meant the federal government would target Black people. “The Biden administration is going to be sending crack pipes and meth pipes, targeting minority communities,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a video message. “I know that sounds insane, I know that sounds too crazy to be true.” In reality, the investment in harm reduction is a drop in the bucket of federal spending, unworthy of a “massive cultural war blowup,” Humphreys said. “Even if the pipes do no good at all I don’t think we should get our knickers in a twist over this,” Humphreys wrote in an email. Republicans did not take issue with just the grant’s potential uses, but also the administration’s response to the controversy they’ve raised. “Once again, ‘misinformation’ just means true facts that make Democrats look bad,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted. After the White House’s response, Rubio announced he would introduce legislation to prohibit the federal funds from going toward “crack pipes or similar drug paraphernalia.” His spokesman later clarified that the proposed bill would be “narrowly focused on crack pipes.” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) threatened to block a stopgap measure to keep the federal government funded until March 11 if she did not receive assurance from the Biden administration that no funds would be allotted for the distribution of crack pipes. Blackburn faced criticism in her last election for taking money from the pharmaceutical makers and distributors blamed for fueling the opioid epidemic, after a Washington Post investigation found a law she sponsored tied the hands of the Drug Enforcement Administration in its efforts to keep addictive painkillers out of the black market. Frustrations aired by Blackburn and others are only the latest fury aimed at drug policy evolving amid the increasingly deadly drug crisis. More than 100,000 people died of overdoses in the 12 months between April 2020 and April 2021, a milestone in a decades-long health crisis. Mike Pence, as governor of Indiana, oversaw in 2015 the worst HIV outbreak in the state’s history, which critics blamed in part on Pence’s opposition to authorizing a needle exchange program. For those in the harm reduction world, this rhetoric isn’t new, but it’s coming at a terrible time when overdoses are soaring. “It doesn’t surprise me someone ran with those talking points,” said Jennifer Plumb, the founder and medical director of Utah Naloxone. Her group, which applied for the grant, would supply clean needles and the overdose antidote throughout her state. Despite hesitancy around harm reduction, Plumb said she’s seen firsthand how effective it is at mitigating the worst repercussions of the drug crisis. More than 7,000 overdoses have been reversed in over six years with the naloxone her group distributes, Plumb said. When naysayers have criticized her group’s work, Plumb has invited them to speak to drug users. “I suppose some folks aren’t interested in the reasonableness,” she said. “They are more interested in the fiery flash points of inciting faux rage where there doesn’t need to be any rage. This is a realm that needs compassion and awareness.” Watch more:",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3JepEev,health
117,2022-02-10,Beijing Winter Olympics becomes microcosm of world’s rivalries and mistrust ," At the 2022 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremonies, a giant LED snowflake surrounded by a sea of dove-shaped lights held by children was meant to embody a Confucian proverb: Under heaven we are all one family. The sentiment — reflected in the official motto, “Together for a shared future” — rang hollow for many. Held under a cloud of suspicion and mistrust, the Games reflect, and in some cases exacerbate, the widening divisions between China and the United States and its allies on the global stage, while doing little to improve China’s reputation. Few times in recent history have athletes walked into such a fraught environment as the Beijing Winter Games. Worried about surveillance and data theft, they have come to China with burner phones, while rights advocates have advised participants, for their own safety, not to comment on human rights or politics while in Beijing. Chinese state media have accused the United States of paying athletes to disrupt the Games and commentators warned citizens to be on alert for U.S. “tricks.” “We are seeing a microcosm of all the tensions, all the concerns about China, with this Olympic bubble being a snow globe of all the issues,” said Maura Cunningham, a writer and historian who studies modern China. For China, sports have long been a channel for diplomatic breakthroughs. In the early 1970s, table tennis matches between the United States and China paved the way for the normalization of relations. The 2008 Summer Olympics introduced China to the international stage and also exposed a generation of Chinese officials, residents and business people to the outside world as more than 6 million tourists poured into Beijing. In contrast, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, held in a tightly controlled bubble of sports venues, hotels and media centers, is muted and closed off — an apt analogy, some say, for China’s growing isolation under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. Under Xi, the government is exerting more control over the economy and society. Chinese diplomats have grown bolder and more triumphalist, touting their country’s superiority to the West. Beijing’s commitment to zero-covid means China — already at loggerheads with the United States and other Western countries over human rights, trade and territorial claims — is further cut off from the outside world. “In some ways, the level of trust has entirely evaporated. There’s not a thing the Chinese could do to reassure the United States and vice versa,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser focusing on Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Even the snowflakes-for-solidarity-themed Opening Ceremonies failed to mask growing differences. Fewer than 25 heads of state or government attended, compared with more than 80 in 2008. The leaders attending included Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose growing alliance with Xi has stoked alarm in Europe as well as in Asia, and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who issued shoot-to-kill orders to put down protests last month. Meanwhile, diplomatic and senior representatives of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and other Western governments were conspicuously absent. The state-run China Daily called such efforts a “futile attempt” to distort the Games. “Sports are sports … not a stage for politicians to make political shows,” it said. In a briefing Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the U.S. allegation about genocide in the western region of Xinjiang was the “lie of the century, which fully exposed its sinister intention of politicizing the Games and maliciously smearing China.” A think tank in Shenzhen published a list of “eight tricks” the United States could employ, including breaking out of controlled zones, having athletes make “indecent gestures” during proceedings, and sending security officials in the guise of support staff to “cause some sort of disruption.” The state-run China Daily, citing anonymous sources, said Washington had hatched a plot that involved paying athletes “to spoil” the Olympics by protesting or “playing passively.” Previous Olympics — from Mexico City in 1968, after security forces killed hundreds of unarmed student protesters, to Moscow in 1980 during the Cold War, or the Nazi propaganda showcase in Berlin in 1936 — also were marked by controversy and protest. In the lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, Tibetan protesters clashed with police, and monks set themselves on fire, sending graphic images across the world. The 2022 Games herald a near future where China commands more influence while becoming more impervious to outside pressure. On Friday, spectators were shocked to see that a Uyghur athlete was chosen to light the Olympic torch, a bold rebuttal to criticism of China’s policies toward the minority group. “It’s saying, ‘We have nothing to apologize for. Live with it,’ ” Kennedy said. Within the Olympic bubble, anxiety and mistrust are high. Athletes sent into coronavirus quarantine have complained about a lack of transparency, substandard food and poor training equipment. American speed skater Casey Dawson, a 21-year-old from Park City, Utah, tested positive for the coronavirus in mid-January and was informed by U.S. Olympic official that he would need four negative tests to enter China. At one point in the process, China removed the lab he used for tests from its approved list, restarting his negative test count at zero. He eventually made it after a three-flight scramble and in no condition to perform his best. He finished about six seconds slower than his personal record, and 28th out of 29 skaters. “There’s obviously anger and a lot of emotions going through my head,” Dawson said. When asked who made him angry, he said, “I’m not going to name names. But just, the whole situation.” Tabitha Peterson, a U.S. curler, said some members of her team had brought burner phones but all had downloaded software to protect their Internet traffic, routed through virtual private networks. “You just never know what to expect,” she said. “We like to prepare and have everything that we need. If you need it, great. If you don’t, great.” The Games have also resurrected Cold War-era fears about the impartiality of judging in certain events. After the disqualification of two South Korean skaters from the short-track event Monday, their delegation said it would appeal the decision, which South Korean Sports Minister Hwang Hee called “nonsensical and preposterous.” South Korean media blasted the officials in Beijing, with one newspaper sarcastically writing, “Let China take all the medals.” Another asked in a headline, “Is this the Olympics?” Chinese fans online, meanwhile, questioned the objectivity of a Canadian judge who gave Chinese snowboarder Su Yiming lower scores at the final men’s slopestyle event on Monday, relegating him to a silver. At the mixed-gender short-track speedskating relay, U.S. and Russian teams were disqualified, allowing the Chinese team to proceed to the final and win the country’s first gold medal of the Games. On Weibo, one fan commented, “Only we are brave enough to penalize America.” For China, the pandemic may be a blessing in disguise as an excuse for closer management and control of the optics. Media are restricted to the bubble, with no interaction with ordinary citizens aside from vetted volunteers. The opportunities for unscripted moments such as a protest are severely limited. “It made it much easier to manage, given all the suspicion on the Chinese side of foreign interference,” said Dali Yang, a University of Chicago professor of political science who focuses on China. For China, the Olympics are a chance to claw back some of the public favor it lost during the first two years of the pandemic as its ties with Western countries deteriorated and attempts at vaccine diplomacy backfired. That may be an uphill battle. “The Chinese have to prove to the Americans or to the world that ‘I’m not the enemy,’ ” said Xu Guoqi, a historian at the University of Hong Kong who has focuses on the history of sports in China. “The ball is in China’s court.” Adam Kilgore and Glynn Hill in Beijing, Pei-Lin Wu in Taipei and Min Joo Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3JhKOs1,asia
118,2022-02-10,Biden promised not to be a senator-president. But what about mayor-president?," CULPEPER, Va. — President Biden, reflecting on his first year in office at a news conference last month, lamented that he was spending too much time in Washington and was acting too much like a senator. “The public doesn’t want me to be the president-senator,” he said. “They want me to be the president and let senators be senators.” Over the past few weeks, President Biden has, in fact, been less of Senator Biden. He’s been a bit more of Mayor Biden. He has touted new factory openings, announcing that a new semiconductor plant was coming to Columbus, Ohio, and cheering an electric vehicle charging station plant opening in Lebanon, Tenn. He has traveled to funerals and visited natural disaster sites more frequently than other presidents, mingling with neighbors and survivors like a local pol. He has expressed envy about the work municipalities can do without the weight of partisanship, where a pothole knows no political party. He is increasingly expressing a yearning for closer proximity to voters outside the White House bubble, where he can get the kind of daily interactions — and immediate feedback — that local officials receive. “Mayors carry the quality of the people’s lives on your shoulders,” Biden told a group of city leaders last month. “Everything you do every day affects their lives more than almost anything anybody else does. And you can make or break a person’s day.” The challenge for Biden these days is that the local feedback he does get is not always neighborly. On Thursday, as he visited a community college here, crude signs and vulgar anti-Biden slogans appeared along his route. A crowd gathered to protest his policies on abortion, transgender athletes and more. “Get your grubby hands off my healthcare,” read one sign. Another — hoisted by a bearded, tattooed man — warned, “We won’t forget what you stole: Jobs, Freedoms, History, Elections, Our Future.” In a sense, Biden has always carried himself as a local pol, and he has attempted to keep that approach even in the presidency. He still spends most weekends at his house in Wilmington, Del. He came up in the politics of Delaware, a small state whose population is exceeded by at least 10 American cities. Biden has a disdain for government-speak, and he doesn’t like it when staffers use acronyms. He tells speechwriters to write as if they were trying to communicate to a family member. For decades, he took pride in working in Washington but never living there, his daily ritual of riding the Amtrak becoming a symbol of his image as an everyman. But despite his professed desire to get out of the Washington area, Biden’s trip here on Thursday was only the third time he’d done so in three weeks. And all of his visits — to Pittsburgh, New York and now Culpeper — have been within 250 miles of Washington. “He’s still trying — he’s trying to get on that plane,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday. “If he could spend every day on the road, he probably would do that.” Instead, she said, he’s been bogged down with other pressing issues. He’s trying to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, she noted, and monitoring Russia’s potential moves into Ukraine. It may not be until after the State of Union address in early March, she added, but there will be more travel. “Otherwise, maybe he’ll fire one of us — I don’t know,” she offered. “But he’s eager to do that. He wants to be out in the country.” Of course, the idea that Biden is more like a small-town mayor than an imperious president, a guy who just wants to mingle with ordinary folks, is partly an exercise in political branding. Still, his glad-handing, backslapping and embracing often seem to perk him up. During the campaign, he would linger for hours talking to voters along the rope line. Arriving at the airport Thursday morning, Biden was greeted by Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and Mayor Frank Reaves Jr. At the Germanna Community College-Daniel Technology Center complex, he met with Joshua Davis, a 12-year-old boy with diabetes, hearing from Davis’s family about high prescription drug costs. On the stage, after the seventh-grader told the audience how insulin shots affect but don’t define him, Biden smiled at the boy’s poise. “I could no more have done that when I was 12 years old than fly,” Biden said, remarking about, and demonstrating, his childhood stutter. He wished Joshua an early happy birthday, noting he’d soon be a teenager. He pointed to his brother and asked his father to stand and be recognized. It was in many ways a typical political event. But Biden has been able to do far fewer of them since entering the White House. Biden got his start in politics when he was elected in 1970 as a New Castle County councilor, a designation that gets prominent mention in the third sentence of the biography posted on the White House website. Matt Meyer, the current New Castle County executive, told a meeting of the National Association of Counties of the time a constituent called Biden to insist that a dead animal be removed from her street. Biden arrived in a pickup truck that night and removed the animal himself. “It was too hard,” Biden said of his tenure as a local official, explaining his decision to run for Senate as a 29-year-old. “They know where you live!” Biden has always spoken of mayors with a certain amount of reverence. “If you noticed, I hired a lot of governors and mayors,” he said during a National Governor’s Association meeting last week. “Because they know how to get things done.” His Cabinet includes Tom Vilsack (former mayor of Mount Pleasant, Iowa), Marcia L. Fudge (former mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio), Marty Walsh (former mayor of Boston) and Pete Buttigieg (former mayor of South Bend, Ind.). When he looked for someone to handle the high-profile role of implementing the infrastructure law, he turned to Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans. He has forged a relationship and alliance with New York Mayor Eric Adams, traveling to hold events with him last week. If there is a mayor — or a former mayor — in the audience, Biden likes to recognize them from the stage. He almost always jokes, “Thanks for the passport into the city.” He has noted that mayors deal with matters on a practical level that Washington may address only in theory, saying, “It sounds silly but, ‘Will the garbage get picked up?’ ‘Will I be safe walking in the park?’ ” He likes that mayors deal with subjects that often are not partisan, and he confesses he has not been able to lower the political temperature in Washington as much as he’d hoped. And he speaks now with a bit of wistfulness at how close a mayor is to his or her constituents. “You know there’s no way to walk into the corner drugstore without being accosted immediately as to what’s going on. Right?” he said to laughter recently in a talk to the Conference of Mayors. “Well, so you know what it means to solve real problems, to be held accountable for the people you serve.” Not all the feedback Thursday was negative. Two women outside the event held supportive signs, one that read: “We ❤️ Joe.” But he remained in his motorcade, needing to hurry back to Washington. He had a meeting that afternoon with senators to discuss a Supreme Court nomination.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3GJhOb8,white house debrief
119,2022-02-10,Biden says he is ‘rejecting’ critical accounts from U.S. commanders about the Afghanistan evacuation," President Biden said Thursday he is “rejecting” the accounts of senior U.S. military commanders in Afghanistan who have said administration officials failed to grasp the Taliban’s rise last year or the urgency with which the United States needed to prepare for an evacuation. Biden said in an interview with NBC News that it did not ring true to him that administration officials ignored warning signs or were in denial about the situation. “No,” he said. “No. That’s not what I was told.” The president, pressed on whether he was rejecting the accounts in the reports, said he was. “Yes, I am,” Biden said. “I am rejecting them.” The president was questioned about his administration’s handling of the evacuation after The Washington Post first reported this week that U.S. commanders overseeing the hastily arranged operation told military investigators that senior White House and State Department officials resisted their efforts to rally support for more meticulous planning well before Kabul’s fall on Aug 15. The criticism from military officials, including Rear Adm. Peter Vasely, the operation’s senior commander, appeared in a U.S. Army report, obtained by The Post through a Freedom of Information Act request. Spanning 2,000 pages, the documents detail the life-or-death decisions faced by U.S. service members ordered to secure Hamid Karzai International Airport for 17 harrowing days as the United States raced to evacuate more than 120,000 American citizens and foreign allies who aided the war effort. The investigation focused on the deadly suicide bombing on Aug. 26 that killed an estimated 170 Afghans and 13 American service members just outside the airport, but the resulting report portrays a much broader portrait of the danger and frustration military personnel encountered as tens of thousands of people desperate to flee descended on the airfield. Biden administration officials have sought to downplay the report’s significance. State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter said that “cherry-picked comments do not reflect the months of work that were well underway, or the whole picture of what the U.S. diplomats undertook to facilitate the evacuation and relocation of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and allies.” Biden on Thursday underscored his belief that it was time to leave Afghanistan, even as critics focused instead on the haphazard manner in which the United States did so. Despite the Pentagon’s recommendation to leave a larger force behind to protect American diplomats and secure the airport, a decision was made to reduce the military’s footprint in Kabul from about 2,500 to 600 personnel. “Look, there’s no good time to get out, but if we had not gotten out, they acknowledge that we would have had to put a hell of a lot more troops back in,” Biden said. “It wasn’t just 2,000, 4,000. We would have had to significantly increase the number of troops, and then you’re back in this war of attrition.” At the war’s peak, during the Obama administration, the United States had about 100,000 military personnel distributed throughout the country. The war resulted in more than 2,300 American deaths and tens of thousands of Afghan fatalities. After the central government collapsed, Biden ordered more than 5,000 additional U.S. troops to the Kabul airport to assist with the evacuation. Marines and soldiers worked on the perimeter of the airport, screening the crowds for American citizens and Afghan allies who had assisted the 20-year U.S. war. A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity citing the issue’s sensitivity, said after Biden’s interview that the president took office with a deadline for the U.S. military to withdraw but no plan to do so. President Donald Trump had signed an agreement with the Taliban to remove all U.S. troops by May 2021, and Biden pushed out that timeline to September. The official said “we immediately went to work planning for every aspect of leaving,” including for an evacuation operation “that eventually helped more than 120,000 individuals fly out of Kabul in a few short weeks.” “Those months of extensive preparation, like the deployment of troops in the region, are reflected in the public record and the Centcom interviews,” the official said, using shorthand for the military organization, U.S. Central Command, that oversaw the investigation. “We reject any assertion that claims otherwise.” Vasely, the top commander in Kabul for the withdrawal, told investigators that military personnel would have been “much better prepared to conduct a more orderly [evacuation] if policymakers had paid attention to the indicators of what was happening on the ground.” Brig. Gen. Farrell Sullivan, a Marine Corps general overseeing aspects of the operation, told investigators that it was his opinion that the National Security Council “was not seriously planning for an evacuation.” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said this week that the report illustrates how people across the U.S. government “were working hard under incredibly difficult circumstances to make the best decisions they could in real time,” and that effort was unprecedented. “Nothing like this had been attempted since the end of the Vietnam War,” he said. “Everyone’s heart, up and down the chain, was in the right place.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3uMZbkl,national security
120,2022-02-10,Biden talks Supreme Court timing with Democratic senators," Democratic senators urged President Biden on Thursday to announce his Supreme Court nomination as soon as possible, and Biden signaled he was moving quickly, as he and his party prepare for a potentially bitter confirmation battle that Democrats hope galvanizes their supporters. “We encouraged him to do it the right way,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the Senate Judiciary chairman. “We’re anxious to get started.” Biden, who has pledged to make his selection by the end of the month, indicated to the senators he would begin interviewing the prospective candidates next week, after he spends this weekend continuing to review their record, according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting. Biden’s strategy session with the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee came as the White House has also reached out to an array of Republican senators in recent days, hoping to minimizing the partisan bloodletting that has characterized Supreme Court nomination fights in recent years. The senators said they did not recommend particular candidates to replace retiring Justice Stephen G. Breyer, despite Biden’s invitation to do so. Instead, they told him the names of potential nominees that had been reported in the press were “encouraging.” The leading contenders include Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, and J. Michelle Childs, a federal district court judge in South Carolina. Other Black women who are sitting judges, as well as prominent civil rights lawyers and legal academics, are also being considered. Biden also told NBC News on Thursday that he has done a “deep dive” on “about four people” for the nomination, and predicted the nomination would get bipartisan support, something rare in recent Supreme Court battles. “I think we’ll get a vote from Republican side for the following reason: I’m not looking to make an ideological choice here,” Biden said. “I’m looking for someone to replace Judge Breyer with the same kind of capacity Judge Breyer had, with an open mind, who understands the Constitution, interprets it in a way that is consistent with the mainstream interpretation of the Constitution.” The FBI has started interviewing people who know Jackson, Kruger and Childs as part of the formal vetting process, according to people familiar with the discussions. It is unclear whether more candidates have gone through the extensive vetting that accompanies an FBI background check, and a White House spokesman declined to comment. Jackson got a boost Thursday from Washington attorney Jamie Gorelick, who praised the judge for her “incisive intellect and balanced, thoughtful demeanor” and said she would make a “superb” justice. Gorelick, who was deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, first met Jackson in the late 1990s when she was in private practice at Gorelick’s former law firm in the District. Jackson’s tenure as a federal public defender and as a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Gorelick said, has given her an “appreciation for criminal justice matters that most Supreme Court justices wouldn’t have in their own personal experience.” As Biden and senior White House aides continue to sift through candidates, they are also privately courting a relatively wide circle of Republican senators who are either viewed as potential votes in favor of the eventual nominee or who sit on the Judiciary Committee, which will take the leading role in scrubbing the candidate. Biden spoke with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on the telephone on Tuesday, and Romney said he urged a Supreme Court pick in the mold of Breyer, who was reliably liberal but also known as a consensus-builder. When Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) spoke with White House counsel Dana Remus two weeks ago about U.S. attorney and lower-court vacancies, she asked him to send any thoughts on the Supreme Court opening her way. Administration officials have also been in touch with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), telling him the White House wants to make the confirmation process bipartisan if possible. In a call with Remus, Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) — the most enthusiastic Republican proponent of Childs, who hails from his home state — promised she could get bipartisan support and touted her non-Ivy League credentials. “We’ve got to get off this Harvard-Yale track,” Graham said. “She’d be far more liberal than the person I would pick, but I expect that.” Every current Supreme Court justice except for Amy Coney Barrett attended Harvard or Yale for law school. In her phone call with Biden last week, and in a subsequent conversation this week with Remus, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) urged the nomination of someone who was not only “extremely well-qualified” but also “within the mainstream of judicial thought,” the senator said. “It truly was a good discussion,” Collins said, adding she told Biden she “would give his nominee fair consideration and look forward to talking with her, interviewing her, that I would use the same criteria that I used in assessing other Supreme Court nominees.” Biden in recent days has also quietly reached out to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on the coming Supreme Court selection. She declined to comment on the call, saying that she considers the same factors with every Supreme Court nominee, with qualifications, judicial temperament and impartiality chief among them. Graham, Collins and Murkowski have been the Republicans most likely to support Biden’s judicial nominees. All three, for instance, voted to confirm Jackson to the D.C. Circuit last year. But Murkowski also said that her support for Jackson for the lower court does not automatically translate into a “yes” vote for her to become a Supreme Court justice. “It is at a level that commands its own evaluation, separate and above everything that we have considered to date,” Murkowski said. “So I kind of look at it as a new page.” In his own conversations, Durbin has promised key Republicans such as Collins and Murkowski they would have access to the eventual nominee, as well as any documents or information they request as the senators do their own vetting. Durbin has also advised the White House that if Republicans send inquiries about the nominee, the administration should “respond quickly.” “I think it would be valuable to the Senate, as well as the Supreme Court, to have a bipartisan vote,” Durbin said. “I don’t know if we can reach it, but I want to try.” Ann E. Marimow, Scott Wilson and Matt Viser contributed to this report.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/33bVGIy,politics
121,2022-02-10,"Biden’s approval rating continues to erode, including with vital parts of his base"," You may recall last month when President Biden was holding a news conference and a reporter asked him how he planned to regain support from independents and 2020 voters who polling showed had soured on his presidency. His response was unusually curt. “I don’t believe the polls,” he said. This is almost certainly not true, of course. Biden may not believe a Quinnipiac University poll showing his national approval at 33 percent, as might be suggested by the extent to which his team sought to tamp down confidence in that result. But he has been doing this long enough to know that polls are an important indicator of popular support. He does believe the polls; he just doesn’t want Democratic legislators or his supporters to put much stock in them. (On that latter point, he needn’t worry.) Unfortunately for Biden, things have not improved since that news conference. On Thursday, CNN released a new poll conducted by SSRS that showed Biden’s approval sinking to 41 percent. That helped push his average approval rating lower as well, as calculated by FiveThirtyEight. Biden’s approval rating is now worse than that of any modern president at the same point in their tenure, according to FiveThirtyEight, save one: Donald Trump. And even in contrast to Trump, Biden is only running about even. What must be particularly galling about the new CNN poll to Biden’s team is that CNN’s polls had been consistently outperforming the average in recent months. As the average dropped late last summer, CNN’s polling stayed up near 50 percent. Then, in January and February, it slipped by nearly 10 points. (On the graph below, the CNN polls are marked at the point when the pollster completed its outreach to respondents.) You can see that shift when we break out various demographic groups, looking at Biden’s peak in CNN’s polling (last April), his November pre-drop numbers and the most recent poll. Over and over, demographic groups slipped a bit from April to November and then turned more sharply downward. The two shifts of which you’ll want to make particular note are the numbers for non-White Americans and Democrats. Among the first group, Biden’s approval sits at 57 percent. Among Black Americans, 92 percent of whom supported Biden in 2020, it’s 69 percent. Ninety-five percent of Democrats voted for Biden, but 83 percent currently approve of the job he’s doing. Approval ratings are volatile, so this could turn around, but in recent years they aren’t that volatile. Since about 2010, approval ratings have mostly been a partisan tug-of-war, with the president’s party strongly backing him and the opposition strongly opposing him. Independents are in the middle and generally drive the overall figure, so Biden’s 15-point drop with that group since last April is important. But the good news, such as it is, is that Biden probably can’t fall too much more; 60 percent of his current approval comes from Democrats and another third from independents, most of whom are probably independents who tend to lean Democratic anyway. You may wonder why it matters that Biden’s approval ratings are low, which is certainly fair. There are two key concerns for Democrats, however. The first is control of Congress. Holding a narrow majority in the first midterm of a presidency is always hard for the president’s party, but when the president is deeply unpopular, that becomes all but impossible. In 2018, for example, economic indicators suggested that Republicans would not get blown out. But Trump’s lousy approval rating suggested that they would, and they were. What followed was the opposition taking power in the House and new pressure on Trump’s presidency. Even before then, though, Biden needs legislators to join him in votes. If embattled Democrats from swing districts think that allying with Biden is toxic to their reelection chances, as he may be, they’re going to be less likely to provide the last few votes to pass controversial legislation. Or they may be perfectly comfortable not having that legislation come to a vote. If Biden’s plan is to pass more legislation targeting his priorities, you can see how a perception that he’s political poison is disadvantageous. The biggest drops on issues, unsurprisingly, came from Biden’s handling of the pandemic (down from 66 percent in April to 45 percent now) and the economy (from 51 percent to 37 percent). But there’s another bit of data from CNN’s poll that may be the thing Biden wants to believe least of all. In January of last year, after the attack at the Capitol, CNN asked respondents if Trump’s presidency was a success or a failure. Forty-one percent said it had been a success; 55 percent said a failure. When they were asked the same question now about Biden’s presidency, the numbers were almost exactly the same.

122,2022-02-10,"Bomb threats damage us, even when nothing explodes"," “ALL CLEAR,” the police said, more than a dozen times, after a bomb threat was called into one of the nation’s historically Black colleges and universities. Whew? Not really. So far, no explosives were found on any of those campuses. But that doesn’t mean there was no damage. Our imperfect nation stumbles and scars even more when we let our kids get dragged back into the ugliest days of our country’s soul. Bomb threats remind us of the deadly Birmingham church bombing of 1963, of the angry White students trying to keep Black students out of schools, of campus violence that haunts us today. A bomb threat, in 2022, caught Marian Turner, a junior at Spelman College in Atlanta, off-guard when I hit her school last month. She didn’t expect to relive what her grandparents experienced. “Black people are still facing discrimination and acts of violence,” Turner said. “The same way our ancestors faced during the civil rights movement and prior.” All the HBCUs that evoke pride and history and progress with just one word — Howard, Spelman, Xavier — got the calls. So did scores of others with lesser known names across the country, from Alcorn State University in Mississippi to Bowie State University in Maryland. The faux bombers knew exactly what they were doing. Though prominent schools such as Howard University in D.C. began getting the calls in January — there have been at least three so far in 2022 — most of the calls flooded the schools at the start of Black History Month this February. These campuses were created as safe spaces for African American students to learn and achieve with freedom and without fear. No coincidence that the timing of the bomb threats come this month, as parts of White America resist learning the full story of Black America. “Like many HBCU students I, myself, view our campuses as safe spaces for achieving excellence and being your pure, authentic selves,” Mikayla Sharrieff, a D.C. native and Spelman student, told Capital B News. “I wanted to be surrounded with people who look like me who also want to make an impact on the world.” Putting the motivations into sharper focus and throwing the scenario even father back in time are the suspects in Florida. “This group from what we can tell, it is a neo-Nazi organization going by the name of Atomwaffen,” Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari Young said at a news conference. The caller told Bethune-Cookman University that there was a bomb on campus and a gunman would open fire at lunchtime. “These threats are being investigated as racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes,” the FBI statement on the investigation said. The threats rattled students, who woke up to shelter-in-place warnings, bomb-sniffing dogs and campus sweeps. Some decided to stay in their dorm rooms and attend classes virtually. Others defiantly went outside, determined not to be silenced. Howard University canceled classes last Friday not because of threats to safety, but because of the toll the threats have taken on the community’s mental health. “Recent events, from the persistence of the covid-19 pandemic to the multiple bomb threats issued against our institution, have taken a toll on all members of our community,” Howard president Wayne A.I. Frederick said in an email to the community. This is the damage being done today. Rather than rip through bodies and buildings, the faux bombers are tearing at the security and safety of a community fabric. When a handful of predominantly Black schools in Washington got bomb threats this week — the day after one came into Dunbar High School while Vice President Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, was visiting students — the immediate fear was that these were racially motivated. And a terrified city responded on social media. “May God be with all of us!” “What? Again? Keep the kids and teachers safe!” “This has to stop.” Police have arrested a 16-year-old from Southeast D.C. for the calls. No Atomwaffen involved. Seems as though it was one of those old-fashioned, pull the fire drill to get out of school thing a kid did for his friends. “I’ve always subscribed to the theory that bombers bomb and threateners threaten,” said Robert Mueck, director of public safety at St. John’s College in Maryland and a member of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators’ Domestic Preparedness Committee, told The Washington Post. Calling in a bomb threat is “more of a nuisance crime,” he said, “like back in high school, kids pulling a fire alarm to get out of an exam.” That doesn’t fly today. No matter what kind of situation a kid is in. That prank is gone forever in America. Because the “all clear” never means the physical threat of violence is over as the pervasive rot of racism continues to fester in our society. On most Black campuses, these threats have too much history behind them to be dismissed as nuisance calls. And current events show us hate crimes aren’t in our past. On all our nation’s campuses, violence is not impossible. The unique American tradition and the bloody bodies left in its wake shows that school violence is possible, probable, even. My son texted me from his private Jesuit school in D.C. as I was writing this. The boys were huddled in the music room’s vault during an active-shooter drill. When they were little, the repeated drills and banging on doors and reminders to stay silent made them cry. Today, they all did the Wordle puzzle. For El’Jhon Ward, a junior at Bowie State who got the email giving a “shelter-in-place” order after a bomb threat last month, it felt all too familiar. “I didn’t really know what that means because I’ve never sheltered in place in college before,” he told WBAL-TV. “But it kind of took us back to high school.” Ah, the memories? As the threat of last century’s racial violence revisits them, today’s generation, living in an era of active shooter drills, may never be “all clear.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3oFwWQz,"localperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
123,2022-02-10,Carolyn Hax: A friend with depression keeps no-showing their plans," Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: I have a friend who struggles with depression. He frequently says things to me like, “I really need to see you, I can’t stand to be alone anymore. Can we get together and go for a walk tomorrow?” I’ll say yes because I care about this friend. Then I show up for the walk at the appointed time, and I’d say a good 75 percent of the time he no-shows without explanation, only to text later to say he was too depressed to get out of bed. If I refuse to make plans with him, he gets depressed and says, “I'm such a failure even my friends won't get together with me.” But if I make plans with him I'm affecting my busy schedule only to be stood up most of the time. Can you think of a gentle, healthy way I can decline to make plans with him? — Friend Friend: Wait — do I still have the option of helping you make better plans with him? It’s possible to build in (and around) the chance of a no-show when you make the plans. For example, you don’t meet at a neutral location. Instead you go pick him up at his place. Maybe even discuss whether your having a key would be appropriate in case of inability to get out of bed. Or, you can plan something you would do anyway and invite him to join you. Let's say you already plan to see a movie or take a long walk — now tell him you're doing it, and he can either join you by X o'clock or not. Or you go out for a drink or coffee and you bring a book with you, so you either spend a blissful hour by yourself reading, or enjoy a successful outing with your friend. I could go on, but I’ll leave you to figure out how to reconcile his fragility and instability with your busyness and frustration. Short answer, if there’s any way you can stay connected to him, then please do. Allie Brosh’s “Hyperbole and a Half” is a brilliant resource for understanding why. Re: Friend: If he is too depressed to get out of bed, believe him. He isn’t doing this to screw you over. My friend with depression has canceled more plans than I can count. I learned not to take it personally and assume plans might get canceled. If she canceled and then uncanceled, I stuck with the canceled, not to teach her anything but for my own mental health. I needed not to keep making and remaking plans. She in turn does not take that personally. The other thing was, as CH suggests, to be okay with canceled plans because I had alternatives. The other other thing was not to drop everything at a moment's notice. “Yes, let's go for a walk, but I'm doing X and Y right now, so I'll be able to walk in an hour.” For your friend, it might be enough to know he will be able to see you/somebody in an hour, so he can hang on that long. Or not, but the main thing is that you plan for this. This is how he’s going to be for the foreseeable future, so find a way to relax into it as much as you can. — Another Friend",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3ozPfqs,"adviceperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
124,2022-02-10,CDC proposes new prescription opioid guidelines for caregivers," The federal government on Thursday proposed new guidelines for prescribing opioids that would eliminate numerical dosage recommendations for treatment of chronic pain in favor of a more flexible approach by caregivers. The recommendations call for doctors and other prescribers to weigh the risks and benefits of starting, increasing and halting treatment with opioids. They leave out previous advice on the amount and duration of painkiller treatments that patients and doctors have contended was sometimes misinterpreted, causing serious harm to people suffering unrelenting pain. Some states and caregivers adopted tight rules based on the recommendations, first issued in 2016, resulting in patients having difficulty obtaining pain drugs or having them cut off abruptly. “There’s not a one size fits all,” said Christopher Jones, acting director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We’ve heard that quite clearly. When you have hard thresholds like 90 [morphine milligram equivalents] or a specific duration, it makes it too easy for policymakers or others to take that out of context and apply that as a rigid cap.” Bobby Mukkamala, chairman of the American Medical Association Board of Trustees, issued a statement saying that “for nearly six years, the AMA has urged the CDC to reconsider its problematic guideline on opioid prescriptions that proved devastating for patients with pain. The CDC’s new draft guideline — if followed by policymakers, health insurance companies and pharmacy chains — provides a path to remove arbitrary prescribing thresholds, restore balance and support comprehensive, compassionate care.” Andrew Kolodny, one of the fiercest critics of opioid manufacturers, said he believes some of the opposition was orchestrated by drug companies that saw the attempt to curb opioid prescribing — especially of high-dose pills — as a threat to their profit margins. The advice on a numerical cap “was necessary and helpful, and the CDC should not have removed it,” said Kolodny, founder of the group Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and medical director for the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. “Taking it out as well as other recommendations in the guidelines are not congruent with the evidence base that the guideline is relying on,” he said. Like the landmark 2016 guidance, the new recommendations strongly urge care providers to first choose non-opioid alternatives for all kinds of pain, including over-the-counter drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), massage, acupuncture and physical therapy. They also offer expanded advice on treatment of acute pain (pain that lasts less than one month), based on research in recent years, Jones said. Wednesday’s 229-page updated proposal comes almost six years after the CDC belatedly tried to curb the liberal use of opioid pills, a treatment approach that developed in an era when caregivers were pressured to treat pain aggressively and drug companies were downplaying the chances of addiction. Doctors complained that they were dispensing large quantities of painkillers without the training on how to do so and that painkillers sometimes proved to be a gateway drug for the use of heroin and illegal street fentanyl. About 165,000 people died of overdoses of prescription painkillers between 1999 and 2016. In regard to the long-term use of opioids, the 2016 recommendations found that “three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed.” Patients, some of whom had been taking opioids for years, rebelled. In 2019, more than 300 health-care experts, including three former U.S. drug czars, told the CDC its guidelines were harming patients. They said the advice had prompted some insurers to refuse reimbursement, led pharmacies to erect obstacles to obtaining drugs and created risks for doctors who wanted to give out more. Collective action has dramatically reduced opioid prescriptions from a peak of 255 million in 2012 to 143 million in 2020, according to the CDC. But deaths from drug overdoses have continued to skyrocket. Nearly 92,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2020, with fentanyl by far the largest cause, according to the agency. The new guidelines, published Thursday in the Federal Register, are not binding on prescribers and are not intended to apply to end-of-life pain care, or pain care for diseases such as cancer and sickle cell anemia. After a public comment period ends April 11, the CDC will decide whether to adopt them and whether to make changes to the proposal.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3Lqga1C,health
125,2022-02-10,Four reasons your rent is going up," Rents are rising nationwide. Average rental listings jumped 14 percent last year, to $1,877 a month, with cities such as Austin, New York and Miami posting increases of 30 to 40 percent, according to real estate firm Redfin. “Rents really shot up in the second half of 2021,” Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, told The Washington Post. “The pandemic was kind of a pause on the economy and now that things are reopening, inflation is picking up, rents are going up and people are realizing they don’t have as much disposable income as they might have thought they had.” Many Americans say they’re seeing big swings as they prepare to renew their leases. What’s behind those increases? Here are four reasons your monthly payment is ticking up. 1. Booming demand as more people want to live on their own. Put simply, demand for rentals is way up. As the pandemic wears on, more people are looking for their own space: Young adults who had hunkered down with their parents at record rates are moving out. People who had roommates now want to live alone. Couples who separated or got divorced each need a place of their own. “Over the last year, households started to split up into smaller households,” said Igor Popov, chief economist at Apartment List, an online marketplace for rentals. “People realized they wanted their own space and flexibility, so all of a sudden you’ve got people who would’ve shared housing in a normal environment looking for individual units.” At the same time, the pipeline of new rentals has stalled. Pandemic-related supply chain disruptions combined with shortages of both workers and materials have resulted in widespread construction delays, leading to a classic case of low demand and short supply driving up prices. The number of U.S. households grew by 1.48 million last year, according to census data, as more people branched out on their own. After spending the first months of the pandemic living with a roommate in Jacksonville, Fla., Erica Santiago recently moved to Tampa with one requirement: an apartment of her own. Santiago, a writer for a marketing firm, says she was tired of worrying about coronavirus exposure and other distractions while working from home. She now pays about $1,500 for a one-bedroom apartment that she shares with her cats, Sushi and Wasabi. “I will say, I’m very happy to be by myself now,” the 27-year-old said. “Aside from not having to worry about coming into contact with covid, I don’t have to worry about other things either: Are they playing music while I’m on Zoom? Is their boyfriend over? Can I work in peace? All of that has become a lot more important.” 2. A pricey — and competitive — housing market that has locked out many would-be home buyers. The housing market has become incredibly competitive during the pandemic. The median home sale price rose nearly 17 percent last year to a record $346,900, according to the National Association of Realtors. But as the wealthy scooped up second homes and investment properties, homeownership has become increasingly out of reach for many others. The NAR estimates that nearly 1 million U.S. renters were priced out of the housing market last year because of rising prices and competition from all-cash offers. As a result, the share of first-time home buyers has fallen to an eight-year low, which means more people are renting for longer than they otherwise would. That’s given landlords and management companies ample leverage to raise rents. Casey Holmes, who pays about $1,800 for a three-bedroom house near Austin, had hoped to buy by now. But he’s been priced out by a booming housing market. Suddenly, he says, his $300,000 budget seems inadequate in an area where the median sales price has risen more than 30 percent to $476,700 in the past year, according to the Austin Board of Realtors. “I’ve looked around quite a bit and I just cannot see myself buying a house here anymore,” the 37-year-old said. “Instead I’m renting for much longer than I thought I would.” 3. Expiration of rent freezes and other measures that helped keep rents low early in the pandemic. Early in the pandemic, many cities, states and management companies placed limits on rent increases and in some cases, froze prices altogether. But as those measures expire, many renters say their landlords are factoring in two years’ worth of rent increases. Last year when local rent freezes lifted in Frederick, Md., Aleksei Valentín and his husband received notice that their monthly rent would be rising by $300, or roughly 25 percent, which was much higher than past hikes. The building had also tacked on about $200 in extra amenity fees, making the one-bedroom unaffordable for the doctoral students. They ended up moving to a studio apartment in a neighboring county. “We were already struggling, but then you see that rent is going up by hundreds of dollars, and there’s just no way,” he said. “It’s not like our pay has gone up by that much.” 4. More wealthy renters. The pandemic has led to seismic shifts in the way people work and live. Among them: the opportunity for white-collar workers, particularly in high-paying industries such as tech and finance, to work from anywhere. As a result, experts say some people are beginning to move from pricey hot spots, such as San Francisco and New York City, to more affordable enclaves, such as Nashville and Tampa. And they are often choosing to rent until they figure out where to permanently buy. “All of a sudden high-paying jobs have given people a whole lot of flexibility to move,” said Popov of Apartment List, who noted that there’s been an influx of renters looking for one-to-six-month leases while they try out new cities. “That wealthier demographic is driving a lot of the heat in the rental market right now because they’re the ones with the dollars to throw around to compete for the limited inventory out there.” Lauren Wolf, who moved from San Francisco to Austin early in the pandemic, was amazed by how much more she could afford in Texas. She found a two-bedroom apartment with parking for $2,100 — which was less than she’d paid for her studio in California. Wolf, an event manager for a tech company, planned to rent for a year, then buy. But she says rising home prices and overall economic uncertainty have kept her from making the plunge. Her plans got pushed back even further a few weeks ago when her monthly payment went up 30 percent to $2,775 a month. “Rents have gone up so much,” the 26-year-old said. “A lot of people I know are having to move outside the city.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3uNeRDQ,economy
126,2022-02-10,"Her execution date looming, a mother maintains innocence in 2-year-old daughter’s death"," The family was almost free of the steep, decrepit stairs leading to their South Texas apartment when they destroyed Melissa Lucio’s life, her attorneys say. Lucio and her husband were moving out of their second-story unit in February 2007 when, her lawyers claim, their 2-year-old daughter, Mariah, fell down the staircase. Although she seemed mostly fine, she was found dead two days later — a result of injuries from her fall, the attorneys say. Prosecutors put forth a different theory: Lucio had intentionally and knowingly killed Mariah by abusing her, they said at trial in Cameron County. Lucio was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death in 2008. Now facing an April 27 execution date, Lucio is making a last-ditch attempt to save her life. In a court motion filed Tuesday, her attorneys argue that she was denied a fair trial and that there is “ample reason to believe” she was wrongfully convicted. “There is just too much doubt,” Vanessa Potkin, an attorney for Lucio and director of special litigation at the Innocence Project, said Thursday. “We cannot move forward in this case and risk executing an innocent woman.” Lucio’s case has wound through several layers of the court system, with no relief. A state appeals court affirmed the verdict. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit concluded that Lucio was denied her right to fully defend herself but said procedural rules barred it from overturning her conviction. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case. If Texas puts Lucio to death, she will become only the sixth woman to be executed in the United States in the past decade. She is also the only Latina woman sentenced to death in Texas’s history. In 2020, her case became the subject of a documentary titled “The State of Texas vs. Melissa.” The Cameron County District Attorney’s Office, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and the office of Gov. Greg Abbott (R) did not respond to questions Thursday about whether they would intervene in Lucio’s case. Key to Lucio’s claim of innocence is a five-hour police interrogation the night Mariah died. Pressured repeatedly to admit to harming her daughter, and deprived of food and sleep, Lucio eventually said, “I guess I did it,” her attorneys wrote in their motion. But the lawyers argued that this acquiescence — characterized by prosecutors as a confession — was invalid. Lucio had a long history of being sexually and physically abused, they said, making her susceptible to the “aggressive, intimidating and psychological” tactics of the male officers. Potkin said police also judged Lucio’s body language, assuming her guilt because she slumped over and made little eye contact during the late-night questioning. “We see that in false confession cases frequently, that there is a misclassification error,” Potkin said. “Police erroneously conclude that somebody did something, and then an interrogation begins.” Jurors never heard testimony to that effect. Lucio’s defense team said they tried to present two expert witnesses to testify that her “confession” was not trustworthy because her history of abuse made her want to please people. But the judge excluded both witnesses on the grounds that their testimony was irrelevant, Lucio’s lawyers wrote in their motion. “There exists serious reasons to doubt the jury’s verdict and death sentence: that jury was prevented from hearing Ms. Lucio’s defense that would have contextualized her custodial statement, the principal evidence against her,” the attorneys wrote. False confessions are not uncommon. About 17 percent of the exonerations in 2019 reported by the National Registry of Exonerations involved false or fabricated confessions. People may admit to crimes they did not commit in part because of intimidation, fear or compromised reasoning abilities, according to the Innocence Project, an organization that seeks to exonerate the wrongfully convicted. In Lucio’s case, her attorneys said a state medical examiner found bruising on Mariah’s body, a fracture in her arm, missing or patchy hair, and marks on her back and concluded that she had been abused and died of a head injury. But Potkin said investigators never seriously considered other possibilities. “There has never been a proper examination of the forensic evidence in this case to determine the medical support that Mariah died accidentally,” she said. Through their latest motion, Lucio’s attorneys are seeking additional time to present evidence of her innocence. If the Cameron County District Attorney does not withdraw its request for an execution date, Potkin said the case will probably continue in state court. The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole, as well as Abbott, would make decisions on a potential clemency application. “There are a number of people who could step in and stop this,” Potkin said.

127,2022-02-10,Hijab protests spread in India as girls face off against Hindu nationalist crowds," A request by a group of high school girls to wear the hijab in class has snowballed into dueling protests between Hindu and Muslim students in India, deepening religious polarization as regional elections approach. Debate over the hijab in schools took off last month after students at a pre-university college in Karnataka state’s Udupi district began protesting a rule barring them from wearing the Muslim head covering in classrooms. In late January, the girls petitioned the state’s high court, challenging the restrictions. But protests quickly spread across the state, as more educational institutions began banning Muslim students from wearing the hijab. Hindu activists have staged counterprotests, demanding that the saffron shawl — a Hindu religious symbol — be allowed in schools. The opposing movements have deepened festering religious polarization in the region and prompted the state to temporarily close secondary schools this week. On Tuesday, protests turned violent, with reports emerging from some cities of stone-throwing and arson, according to the BBC. Muskan Khan, a student in the city of Mandya in Karnataka state who wears the headscarf, became the face of resistance to the hijab bans after a video of her went viral this week. The clip showed Khan, 19, pumping her fist and shouting “Allahu akbar” (“God is great”) at a group of men who were heckling her as she entered her college. The men wore saffron scarves and chanted “Jai Shri Ram” — “Victory to Lord Ram,” a call popular among Hindu nationalist groups. “All that I want is to stand by my rights and education,” Khan told the BBC after the incident. Muskan Khan, an Indian Muslim woman who wears the hijab, is being praised for standing up to a far-right Hindu mob outside her college. A ban on headscarves in universities in Karnataka state has angered Muslim students across India, prevented Muslim women from attending classes pic.twitter.com/NbG4M4UNAT Demonstrations have spread to India’s capital, Delhi, and cities including Kolkata, where students blocked roads in protest of hijab prohibitions in Karnataka, Reuters reported. On Thursday, women in two cities in neighboring Pakistan protested in solidarity. Unlike in some European countries that have seen fierce debates over the veil, there are no nationwide restrictions on wearing the hijab in public places in India. But a growing number of schools and officials in Karnataka have begun saying that religious garments should not be worn in the classroom. “Government is very firm that the school is not a platform to practice dharma [religion],” Karnataka education minister B.C. Nagesh told CNN affiliate CNN News-18. Officials have also said saffron scarves are forbidden in class. A student identified as Al-Rifa told the Indian news publication Scroll.in that her school in Karnataka was “forcing us to choose between studies and the hijab” and that female Muslim students feel unsafe on campus. “I was made to realize that I am a Muslim. Someone who dresses differently,” she said. “I have never thought about these things before.” The protest movement got a high-profile endorsement Tuesday, when Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani advocate for girls’ education who also wears a headscarf, condemned the hijab ban on Twitter. “Refusing to let girls go to school in their hijabs is horrifying,” she wrote. “Objectification of women persists — for wearing less or more. Indian leaders must stop the marginalization of Muslim women.” V P Sanu, national president of the Students’ Federation of India, also criticized the ban, writing on Twitter that the hijab was being “cited as reason to deny Muslim women’s right to education.” Human Rights Watch also decried the ban as discriminatory. “College is forcing us to choose between studies and the hijab”.Refusing to let girls go to school in their hijabs is horrifying. Objectification of women persists — for wearing less or more. Indian leaders must stop the marginalisation of Muslim women. https://t.co/UGfuLWAR8I The rival protests between hijab-wearing Muslim students and saffron scarf-wearing Hindu students has deepened communal tensions in the region. Karnataka authorities closed high schools and colleges for three days this week as the threat of violence mounted. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai announced Thursday that classes would resume Monday. The state’s high court had ordered the government to reopen schools but prevent students from wearing any religious dress until it delivers a verdict on petitions seeking to overturn the hijab ban. The court has adjourned until Monday. Muslims make up about 13 percent of the population in Karnataka, which is a stronghold of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu right-wing BJP party. Since coming to power in 2019, the regional government has passed orders tightening the slaughter of beef in the state and introduced a controversial bill that would make it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry and for people to convert to Islam or Christianity. Five other states in India head to the polls beginning Thursday to kick off a high-stakes election season, and identity politics are taking center stage. Experts say the BJP has sought to benefit from polarization between Hindus and Muslims. Across India, anti-Muslim hate speech is on the rise. And police have taken little action against those involved in events where crowds pledged to kill Muslims. Over the past year, activists have observed an uptick in incidents of discrimination and violence against minorities in the region. This included a spate of attacks on Christians and their places of worship as well as attacks on interfaith couples. Rudabeh Shahid, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center, said she thinks the contestation over the hijab in Karnataka is part of a “wider design” to fuel polarization ahead of the state’s elections next year. It has also tapped into fears among India’s Muslims about losing their rights, she said. “I don’t really think it’s about the hijab at all,” Shahid said. “It’s pretty much related to this environment of hate speech and people’s citizenship being under question.” Sectarian tensions on display in Karnataka could also influence votes in states holding elections this year, she added. Aliya Assadi, 17, who has worn the hijab since she was 7 years old, said she and her classmates sat in the hallway of their all-girls secondary school in Karnataka all day after they were barred from attending classes. Initially, their Hindu classmates were supportive. But that soon changed, Assadi said. “It breaks my heart to see my classmates and friends change so fast and speak on communal lines. It simply makes me cry,” she said. “I know they are not bad people. I know they are being used by politicians. But still, it is painful to see your friends endorse hatred.” Shams Irfan in Srinagar, India, contributed to this report. ",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3GKuWg5,asia
128,2022-02-10,House Oversight asks Archives for information about Trump’s handling of White House records ," The chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee is moving quickly on her promise to investigate Donald Trump’s handling of White House records on the heels of revelations that 15 boxes of materials were recovered from the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence. In a letter sent Wednesday to Archivist of the United States David S. Ferriero, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) requested information “to examine the extent and impact” of Trump’s apparent violations of the Presidential Records Act, which requires the preservation of memos, letters, notes, emails, faxes and other written communications related to a president’s official duties. The letter, provided to The Washington Post, asked for a detailed inventory of the contents of the recovered boxes, a description of records that Trump “destroyed or attempted to destroy” without the approval of the Archives, and whether the contents are undergoing a review to determine if they contain classified information. Maloney also asked whether ""the Archivist has notified the Attorney General that former President Trump removed presidential records from the White House.” “Removing or concealing government records is a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison,” Maloney wrote. “Former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, for example, was prosecuted for taking classified documents from NARA. Former President Trump and his senior advisors must also be held accountable for any violations of the law.” The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the Archives asked the Justice Department to examine Trump’s handling of White House records, sparking discussions among federal law enforcement officials about whether they should investigate the former president for a possible crime, according to two people familiar with the matter. In her letter, Maloney went on to note that “Republicans in Congress obsessively investigated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server for official communications,"" while “Trump’s conduct, in contrast, involves a former president potentially violating a criminal law by intentionally removing records, including communications with a foreign leader, from the White House and reportedly attempting to destroy records by tearing them up.” In a statement Wednesday, Trump said he had engaged in “collaborative and respectful” discussions with the Archives and had arranged for the “transport of boxes that contained Presidential Records in compliance with the Presidential Records Act.” He said that the media had falsely characterized his relationship with the National Archives and Records Administration as hostile and that it was a “great honor” to work with the agency. “Much of this material will someday be displayed in the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library for the public to view my Administration’s incredible accomplishments for the American People,” Trump said. The deadline for Maloney’s request is Feb. 18.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3B9AL5q,politics
129,2022-02-10,"In campaign ad, GOP Senate candidate shoots gun at actors playing Biden, Pelosi and Sen. Mark Kelly"," A Republican businessman seeking his party’s nomination to face Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) in the fall has released a new Western-style TV ad in which the candidate, dressed as a sheriff, fires a gun at actors portraying Kelly, President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The candidate, energy executive Jim Lamon, said in a tweet that the ad will air during the Super Bowl. Kelly is the husband of former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot in the head while greeting constituents outside a Tucson supermarket in 2011. Six people were killed in the shooting rampage and many others were injured. Shannon Watts, the founder of the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, called the ad “disgusting.” Arizona has had enough of the DC Gang’s open borders, high gas prices, and shifty politicians pushing us around. @CaptMarkKelly @JoeBiden @TeamPelosi, it’s time for a good old-fashioned showdown. Check out our new Super Bowl ad, The Showdown, here ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/mJTbFuS0du Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., called on Lamon to remove the ad. “You owe Gabby & @CaptMarkKelly an apology,” Guttenberg said in a tweet addressed to Lamon. “Remove this!!!” The ad is the latest video by a Republican raising the specter of violence against Democrats. In November, Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) shared an altered, animated video depicting him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and swinging two swords at Biden. The House later voted to censure Gosar over the video. Former president Donald Trump, whom Lamon supports, also frequently alluded to violence against his political opponents. In the Lamon ad, the trio of Democrats is shown wearing cowboy hats and boots, toting guns and sporting bandannas on the lower half of their faces. They approach a dusty Old West town, where one onlooker calls them “the D.C. gang” another yells at them, “We’re tired of being pushed around!” “The good people of Arizona have had enough of you,” Lamon tells the actors playing Kelly, Biden and Pelosi in the ad. “It’s time for a showdown.” The Democrats draw their weapons. Then Lamon draws his pistol and quickly shoots the weapons out of their hands, prompting the trio to run away. A Lamon campaign spokesperson did not directly address criticism that the ad shows the candidate shooting at Giffords’s husband. The spokesperson, who did not provide a name, said the ad “shows the D.C. Gang drawing on Lamon and he merely shoots the weapons out of their hands.” “Unlike Kelly, Jim Lamon will shoot straight with Arizonans and take the fight to Biden — and he d--- sure won’t let the left bully him into backing down,” the spokesperson said. The Kelly campaign declined to comment on the Lamon ad. The Lamon campaign is spending “multiples of six figures” on the aid, which it said will air in Tucson during the Super Bowl and in Phoenix and statewide on cable and online thereafter. The ad also includes an appearance by Brandon Judd, a longtime Border Patrol agent. Judd has led the National Border Patrol Council since 2013, involving it more directly in electoral politics. In 2016, the union endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, backing Trump and praising him as someone who “doesn’t fear the media, doesn’t embrace political correctness and doesn’t need the money.” Judd has also been a sought-after surrogate for Republican campaigns, appearing in ads for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and for George P. Bush, a Texas railroad commissioner running for attorney general. In a statement Thursday night, Judd defended the ad as “clearly satirical.” “I do not believe the people of Arizona will be upset by the commercial and will accept it for what it was meant to be … satire based upon Arizona’s history in which no one was depicted as being harmed,” Judd said.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3gFZC7z,politics
130,2022-02-10,"In Russia’s borderlands near Ukraine, military buildup becomes part of the scenery"," ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia — From a train window, travelers had a rolling view of some of Russia’s vast military realignment: a warehouse with armored vehicles and antiaircraft guns near a base in southwestern Russia, not far from the border with Ukraine. Nearby, troops, radio equipment and other military cargo made their way along highways, then onto smaller, rutted roads near Novocherkassk, about 15 miles northeast of the regional hub, Rostov-on-Don. Novocherkassk is the headquarters of the 8th Guards Combined Arms Army, which was reestablished in 2017 to cover Russia’s southwestern borders and is ready to deploy in the case of a threat to the breakaway corner of Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. The base is also a nerve center in a growing Russian military buildup that the United States and allies fear could be the vanguard of an invasion of Ukraine meant to block its Western ties and aspirations of future NATO membership. Russia insists it has no plans for military action, but has not stepped back from demands for guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO. And, still, more forces arrive near Rostov-on-Don. Just outside the Novocherkassk train station earlier this month, the Russian military conducted drills for tank crews to practice “skills in driving through difficult terrain conditions,” according to a Russian Defense Ministry news release. They rumbled over the doughy mix of snow and thick, clay-like soil. In January, the same training grounds at the Kadamovsky Range were the site of snap drills to see how efficiently a local motorized rifle division could deploy after traveling long distances. According to the most recent U.S. intelligence assessment, Russia is close to completing its buildup near Ukraine, having dispatched 83 battalion tactical groups. This is about 70 percent of what Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to launch a large-scale operation, U.S. intelligence estimates say. Moscow sent Washington a list of “security proposals,” including a ban on admitting Ukraine to NATO and scaling back the alliance’s presence in Eastern Europe. The United States and NATO rejected the key demands, and now talks hang in a diplomatic limbo with no clear path to a swift resolution. Meanwhile, videos of Russia’s military moving hardware and troops toward the country’s western borders continue to pile up on TikTok and Instagram, with some units hailing from Far Eastern bases thousands of miles away. When approached by The Washington Post, many people in Rostov-on-Don were reluctant to talk about a war possibly breaking out next door, saying they are too preoccupied with everyday struggles, poor roads, or the coronavirus pandemic as cases spike again in Russia. Those who did comment seemed fatigued by all the brinkmanship. “I don’t watch the news or TV,” said Alisa Kantemirova, 22. “However, I see all these TikToks and it’s worrying.” “But I try not to get into politics,” she added, “because if I do, my panic attacks will triple.” “It will happen, but who knows when?” said Alexander, 36, while on a stroll with his pregnant wife in one of the city’s parks. “Nobody wants it, of course, but it’s a conflict where it’s brothers against brothers, and this division must resolve somehow.” Like others, he spoke on the condition that only his first named be used for fear of drawing the attention of local authorities. The tendency to tune out the crisis is common among Russians, said Denis Volkov, head of the Moscow-based Levada Center, an independent polling group. “That’s a very typical answer,” Volkov said. “The respondents often say: ‘Whenever I hear anything about Ukraine, I immediately switch the channel. I don’t want to hear it. I don’t want to be scared. There is blood and bad news. We are tired of Ukraine.’” For years, Russian state media conditioned its viewers to think of the Ukrainian government as chaotic and violent, ridiculing its presidents and parliament. “Russia has no motivation to attack Ukraine and conduct large-scale military operations against it, and every sane person understands that,” said a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician, Ilya Kiva, on Russia’s “60 Minutes” TV show. “But you need to have brains for that … unfortunately the Ukrainian authorities don’t have one.” Now, as Ukrainian civilians train in guerrilla tactics in case of Russian aggression, a potential war is seen as a defensive one on the Russian side of the border. “What invasion? We are not invading anyone and have never invaded!” said Mikhail, 56. “Didn’t Ukraine mass their soldiers near our borders? Didn’t NATO approach our borders?” According to a December poll by the Levada Center, just 4 percent of Russians think Moscow is the aggressor in the current escalation with the West, while the majority blame the United States. It’s a long-standing trend. Russians tend to consider all conflicts their country has engaged in — for example, the 2008 war in Georgia — to be proxy standoffs with the West, said Volkov. “The overall fear of a major war is strong, and it has been for years. Another thing is that there is understanding that we don’t want to have [a war,] it’s the other side. They are cooking it up and we can only respond,” Volkov said.  The message from Putin’s Kremlin: “Russia doesn’t want to, but it must intervene,” Volkov said. “Look, we survived so much and we will survive this,” said Valentina, a pensioner in a village near a newly built World War II memorial park, Sambekskie Vysoty, which features burned German tanks as a reminder of Russia’s victory in the Great Patriotic War, as it is known in Russia. “We are used to these flare-ups,” she said. “They come and go. But we need to live our lives.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3JgG0Dh,europe
131,2022-02-10,"Indian activist charged with terrorism was targeted by hackers linked to prominent cyber espionage attacks, new report finds"," NEW DELHI — In early 2021, India was jolted by revelations that a jailed human rights activist and vocal government critic was targeted by hackers who planted incriminating evidence on his laptop before he was arrested on terrorism charges. Now, a year later, a report by U.S. experts says the activist, Rona Wilson, was targeted by two separate groups, including one group that has been linked to widely documented cyberespionage campaigns against military targets in China and Pakistan, India’s top foreign adversaries. The report notes that the other group, responsible for planting documents on the activist’s device, dubbed ModifiedElephant by SentinelOne, shared hacking infrastructure with an attacker that researchers have long suspected of state-sanctioned political espionage. The findings, published in a report by the California-based cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, shed light on what amounted to a concerted, nearly decade-long effort to surveil a group of dissidents. It also offers new clues about the connections between groups that cybersecurity experts have observed targeting foreign adversaries and domestic critics. The report does not identify the people who carried out the attacks or the entity that ordered them but notes that ModifiedElephant’s activity “aligns with Indian state interests.” “Two separate groups going after the same target suggests they were tasked with the job by the same entity,” said Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, a principal threat researcher and co-author of the SentinelOne report. According to SentinelOne researchers, Wilson received dozens of emails — often from other activists he knew and sometimes disguised as news articles — that contained malware designed to infiltrate his computer. The Washington Post reported in April on a separate forensic analysis that found that, years before his arrest, an unknown hacker compromised Wilson’s computer and planted at least 32 documents, including a letter discussing a plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi that authorities have cited as evidence against him. SentinelOne found that ModifiedElephant shared web domains with a hacking group known as Hangover. SentinelOne’s research built on a 2013 report that found Hangover had attacked commercial businesses and national security interests in Europe, the United States and Pakistan. The SentinelOne report identified the second group targeting Wilson as SideWinder, a group that is well known to international cybersecurity researchers who have tracked its operations against government and military targets in Pakistan and China. Three independent experts in the United States and Europe reviewed the SentinelOne report at The Post’s request and concurred with its conclusions. The new findings suggest Wilson, a 50-year-old human rights activist awaiting trial in a jail outside Mumbai, was the target of an extensive cyberattack campaign that involved more than one hacker and spanned nearly a decade, a longer time frame than previously known. India’s National Investigation Agency, the prosecuting authority in the case, did not respond to a request for comment. Wilson’s case has sparked controversy in India at a time when Modi’s government is battling allegations of hacking and surveillance of its opponents. Last year, an investigation by a global consortium including The Post revealed that hundreds of phone numbers from India appeared on a global list that included some numbers selected for surveillance by NSO Group’s clients using its Pegasus tool, which is licensed only to government agencies. Those on the list included Indian activists, journalists and opposition party leaders. The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied that it is an NSO client. In December, Amnesty International said a forensic analysis of a backup of Wilson’s iPhone 6s found traces of Pegasus spyware. Wilson was arrested in 2018 along with lawyers and academics in what is known as the Bhima Koregaon case, which began as an investigation into a violent clash between Hindu nationalists and Dalits, formerly known as “untouchables.” Prosecutors charged Wilson and 15 others under an anti-terrorism law, alleging they had ties with a banned Maoist militant group, charges they deny. U.N. experts have called on the Modi government to release the defendants. Last July, one of the defendants, an 84-year-old Jesuit priest, died in a hospital after his health deteriorated in jail. Last year, Arsenal Consulting, a Massachusetts-based digital forensics firm, found that the computers of Wilson and a co-defendant, lawyer Surendra Gadling, had been hacked by an attacker that planted dozens of documents on them, later cited by prosecutors as evidence. Arsenal analyzed electronic copies of their computers at the request of the defense team and worked pro bono. SentinelOne’s report takes the findings further. ModifiedElephant, the main hacker, sent emails with documents or attachments — laden with commercially available malware like NetWire and DarkComet — that were tailored to the victim’s interests and were often copied to multiple recipients they knew, SentinelOne said. Wilson received at least 32 emails from ModifiedElephant, and Gadling was the recipient of 40 such mails from the group. Dozens of other members of civil society, including other co-defendants, were also targeted by ModifiedElephant, though it is not known how many were successfully infiltrated. SentinelOne based its research on an analysis of Arsenal’s findings, malware infrastructure and more than 100 phishing emails received by Wilson and his co-defendants. SentinelOne requested the emails from the defense team and conducted the work pro bono. The researchers said the earliest attack on Wilson can be traced back to a decade ago, though the email attacks intensified in 2014 and continued until at least 2016. The phishing emails were traced to two distinct groups that sent messages from free services such as Gmail and Yahoo around the same time. Besides ModifiedElephant, SideWinder, a group that typically attacks foreign targets and has been tracked for years by international researchers, sent at least four malicious emails to Wilson between 2013 and 2014. It is unknown whether the SideWinder attacks were successful. In 2019, the Pakistani government issued an advisory detailing attacks on its defense and government offices by SideWinder and calling it an Indian attacker. SentinelOne identified the two groups by tracking the Web domains associated with the emails. The report also found evidence that links ModifiedElephant to Hangover. At least two web domains used by ModifiedElephant for sending phishing emails to Wilson were linked to Hangover, suggesting an overlap between the two groups, SentinelOne said. Hangover was accused of attacking Norway’s state-owned telecom company in 2013. Snorre Fagerland, a Norwegian cybersecurity researcher who co-wrote a 2013 report on Hangover, said the newest details about the campaign against Wilson contribute to a better understanding of the ties between attackers who may be operating in India and targeting foreign adversaries and domestic dissidents alike. “It’s safe to say that we have learned a lot over the last decade,” Fagerland said, “not only about the methods, but also about targeting and how the Indian advanced persistent threat ecosystem works.” ",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3LjRtUF,world
132,2022-02-10,"ISIS leader probably rigged his house to explode, U.S. says, but questions about death toll remain"," SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt — The building in northwest Syria where U.S. forces found the Islamic State’s leader was probably rigged to explode, according to four U.S. officials with detailed knowledge of the operation, but it remains unclear who inside the home detonated the blast and why the Pentagon’s tally of those killed during last week’s raid differs from that of aid groups that sifted through the rubble in its immediate aftermath. The Pentagon maintains that the Feb. 3 raid on the dwelling in the village of Atma, resulting in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, was “exquisitely planned” and undertaken with extreme care to minimize the risk of collateral damage. U.S. officials say Qurayshi or someone else inside triggered the explosion before U.S. troops entered. But military leaders are facing questions about whether additional deaths at the scene documented by UNICEF and similar organizations were avoidable. U.S. officials have counted at least seven deaths in the building, including Qurayshi and three family members they say were with him, at least one of whom was a child. All were killed in the blast, which destroyed much of three-story building’s top floor. U.S. officials count three others who were killed on the building’s second floor, including an aide to Qurayshi, the aide’s wife and a child. Two other adults, whom the Pentagon suspected of having links to a separate terrorist organization, were fatally shot by U.S. forces outside near a separate building while brandishing weapons, military officials say. But aid groups say some of the dead — particularly children — may be going uncounted. On the day of the strike, UNICEF stated that at least six children had been killed in Atma on the night of the strike “due to heavy violence” and that “civilian-populated areas were severely damaged.” Speaking to reporters Thursday, two U.S. military officials closely involved with the operation said it remains unclear why there are discrepancies between the number of children whom U.S. troops counted among the dead and the number reported by aid organizations. “I have not seen anything that leads me to conclude there were a different number of casualties than we’ve seen,” said one of the officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because the operation remains highly sensitive. But, he acknowledged, “it was certainly within the realm of possible that there were additional things.” U.S. forces began planning the raid in September, regularly rehearsing with models, including a full-scale mock-up of the house, the two senior military officials involved in the operation said Thursday. The objective was to take Qurayshi alive, collect any intelligence from the compound “and of course avoid any unnecessary civilian harm,” one of the officials said. The Pentagon has faced scrutiny for an apparent pattern of conducting errant or overly aggressive attacks, often through the use of powerful airstrikes that have resulted in civilian deaths. In recent months, defense officials have launched two high-profile investigations of the use of deadly force against civilians, probing an Aug. 29 strike in Kabul in which a humanitarian aid worker was misidentified as a terrorist and a March 2019 strike in Baghouz, Syria, that killed dozens during the final days of U.S. operations there against the Islamic State. Last month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin directed the Pentagon to devise plans for reducing civilian casualties. Pentagon officials are acutely aware that the collateral cost of the Qurayshi raid would come under scrutiny. They took pains to emphasize that it was undertaken with a long-range, helicopter-borne ground force — despite the additional complication and risk of such an operation — precisely because senior military leaders wanted to minimize the likelihood of unintentional civilian deaths or injuries. In the months they spent observing the building, U.S. personnel deemed that no one apart from Qurayshi, his lieutenant and their families had any links to the Islamic State or even were aware the terrorist organization’s leader was living on the residence’s third floor. They determined that “really no one” in the village seemed to be aware of Qurayshi’s presence and that “clearly it was a case of hiding in plain sight,” a senior military official said Thursday. It is unclear, the military officials said, whether Qurayshi detonated the explosive device or a member of his family did so. Brian Castner, a former Air Force bomb technician experienced in post-blast assessments and a senior crisis adviser for Amnesty International, said the rubberized tubing visible in photographs of the rubble is commonly used in demolitions. “This is more evidence,” he said, “to the theory that the house may have been rigged up to explode, and only part of it did.” U.S. officials have yet to conclude whether anyone who did not reside in the building was put at risk because of how the operation evolved once in progress. “What I am confident of is that we had a good understanding that we did not cause any additional, any noncombatant casualties, to our knowledge,” a senior military official said Thursday, with the caveat that he wanted to have “a little bit of humility” about the scope of the Pentagon’s assessments. He noted that the personnel involved in the raid had only limited time to assess the aftermath of the attack before departing the scene. The night of the raid, about two dozen U.S. troops, including members of the elite Delta Force, descended on Qurayshi’s adopted hometown around 1 a.m. They were backed by Apache helicopter gunships, attack jets and Reaper drones, which provided aerial surveillance. U.S. troops first called out to people in the three-story building using a bullhorn. The family on the first floor — a man, a woman and several children — were escorted away from the scene by U.S. troops and turned over to another family nearby for safety, the two U.S. military officials familiar with the operation said. Moments later, the blast collapsed much of the top floor, killing Qurayshi and at least three of his family members, including at least one child, military officials say. The force of the blast ejected the terrorist leader from the building, according to previous U.S. accounts of the operation. His remains were left at the scene, officials have said. As U.S. personnel moved through the building, a gunfight transpired on the second floor, where a male fighter and a female fighter — assessed to be Qurayshi’s aide and that aide’s wife — were killed, military officials say. A child was found dead with them, killed by what U.S. officials surmise was “concussive force” from the blast upstairs — though the cause of death remains unconfirmed. Four other children who had been on the second floor were saved, the officials said. Military officials acknowledged they cannot account for whether other exchanges of gunfire resulted in additional civilian casualties. Troops taking part in the raid took incoming fire before entering the building, U.S. officials said Thursday. And at one point, as the raid force attempted to clear the second floor of Qurayshi’s building, two armed militants believed to be from a local al-Qaeda-linked group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, appeared outside, officials said. U.S. forces killed them in self-defense, officials said, from their perch in a helicopter above. Those militants, the officials said, were standing in front of a separate structure at the time. Whether any civilians may have been caught in the crossfire remains unclear, they acknowledged. “What we don’t have is a solid characterization of what every single building was or who lived in every single building,” one of the officials said. “That was beyond the scope of our abilities to understand.” The damage done to that structure, about 500 feet south of Qurayshi’s residence, was probably caused by 30-millimeter rounds, according to Mark Hiznay, associate arms director for Human Rights Watch, who examined imagery of the aftermath. The cannon firing those rounds, formally referred to as a M230 chain gun, typically is used to target personnel and light armored vehicles, he said. Asked about video footage, the U.S. military officials said that little exists showing what happened once the raid force landed, because those resources were focused on scanning the area for additional threats to U.S. personnel, not on documenting what transpired at the house.

133,2022-02-10,"Launch of Russian military drills stokes fears of preparations for attack on Ukraine, as diplomatic sparring continues"," KYIV, Ukraine — Russia began 10 days of military exercises in Belarus on Thursday involving tens of thousands of troops, with warships entering the Black Sea for large-scale naval drills that Ukraine’s  Foreign Ministry said would render international shipping lanes “virtually impossible” to navigate. The activity got underway as a flurry of high-stakes diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared to falter. In Berlin, negotiators representing Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany failed to come to an agreement after nine hours of discussions seeking a resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. At the United Nations in New York, Washington and Beijing sparred, with a top Chinese diplomat accusing the United States of “hyping up the tension.” In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was like “the deaf talking to the blind.” The smallest of silver linings emerged from remarks Russian President Vladimir Putin gave to reporters late in the day, making it clear he had not yet given up on the diplomatic track and would soon send a written response to de-escalation proposals by NATO and Washington. “As for further talks with our European, American partners, they are continuing both in an open and behind-closed-door manner,” Putin said. A detachment of six Russian landing ships arrived at the Sevastopol port in Russia-annexed Crimea, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement, capping a 7,000-nautical-mile journey from the Baltic Sea. The ships typically are used for unloading troops, vehicles and materiel onto land. Some took part in Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008. Ukrainian officials described the maneuvers as “destructive activity to destabilize the security situation” and accused Russia of violating international law by restricting wide swaths of sea to conduct missile and artillery fire training. “These actions pose another threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a statement. “By blocking the recommended sea lanes, the Russian Federation has made it literally impossible to navigate in these areas and allow ships to enter Ukrainian seaports, especially in the Sea of Azov.” Top Russian military commanders have traveled to Belarus for the maneuvers, which involve sophisticated weapons systems including S-400 surface-to-air missiles, Pantsir air defense systems and Su-35 fighter jets. Officials in Moscow and Minsk have said Russian troops will withdraw after the exercises, which have put Russian troops in striking distance along Ukraine’s southern coastline. Russia denies any plans to invade Ukraine and continues to accuse the United States and NATO of driving up tensions. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the military drills would not affect commercial operations in the Black Sea. He said Russia was staging the joint exercises with Belarus to combat “unprecedented security threats … the nature and, perhaps, concentration of which are, unfortunately, much larger and much more dangerous than before.” The training exercises are the largest Russia has ever conducted in Belarus. They include small-group tactics and operations to detect ambush sites for improvised explosive devices, according to Russia’s Tass news agency, in apparent preparation for urban battles and unconventional warfare against militias and volunteers. Amid concerns that the exercises could create a dangerous environment as Western militaries deploy troops farther east, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, phoned his Belarusian counterpart Thursday, “to reduce chances of miscalculation and gain perspectives on current European security,” a joint staff spokesperson said in a statement. Moscow’s military deployments are nudging some countries that Putin considers part of Russia’s sphere of influence further toward the West. Lithuania’s president said Wednesday that his Baltic country would ask Washington to station troops there permanently to help boost security. U.S. and European officials are continuing to push for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, though efforts such as French President Emmanuel Macron’s trips to Moscow and Kyiv this week have produced no breakthrough. Political advisers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met Thursday in Berlin for “Normandy format” talks that aim to implement the Minsk agreements, signed after Moscow seized Crimea in 2014. But Moscow and Kyiv are deeply divided on how to proceed. “There are differences of opinion,” said German government spokesman Wolfgang Büchner. “In essence, it will be a question of further reducing them.” Russia’s ambassador to Germany, Sergei Nechayev, reportedly told German news media that Berlin and Paris should be “more assertive” in urging Kyiv to accept and implement the terms of the peace accords. Kyiv’s political leadership has argued that the deal, which is focused on the breakaway parts of eastern Ukraine, should be renegotiated. It is widely regarded by Ukrainians as favorable to Moscow-backed separatists; Ukrainian officials have said it would trigger internal unrest if fully implemented. Putin said in a statement Thursday that the world is becoming “more and more turbulent and tense,” requiring Russia to seek “comprehensive, legally enforceable security guarantees for our country from the United States and its NATO allies.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking at NATO headquarters in Brussels, said the next few days are “probably the most dangerous moment.” A “combination of sanctions and military resolve plus diplomacy is what is in order,” he said, before heading to Warsaw for meetings with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and President Andrzej Duda. In the first visit to Moscow by a British foreign secretary in four years, Truss warned Russia that invading Ukraine would be “disastrous.” She urged Russia to abandon “Cold War rhetoric” and pursue a path of diplomacy, saying the West cannot “ignore the buildup of over 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border and the attempts to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.” At a tense news conference after their talks, Lavrov said “our attempts to explain ourselves have fallen on deaf ears,” according to a translation on ITV News. He departed the event quickly, leaving Truss alone at her podium. Anglo-Russian relations have been frosty for years, hitting a low point after a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. Western nations are stepping up their military presence in the region even as they pursue a diplomatic solution. London, which is playing an outsize role in trying to resolve the crisis, has placed 1,000 troops on standby in the event that a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine triggers a humanitarian and refugee crisis. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said during a visit to Kyiv that Ukraine will receive some Stinger antiaircraft missile launchers “in the near future.” The man-portable launchers are intended to bolster Ukraine’s ability to shoot down helicopters and low-flying aircraft. The Biden administration is readying plans for U.S. military forces to help evacuate Americans once they cross into Poland in the event of a Russian attack. The last American service member to leave Afghanistan in August, Army Maj. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue of the 82nd Airborne Division, is the commander in Poland coordinating the effort. The United States is also moving some troops from Germany to Romania to support NATO’s eastern flank. A Stryker squadron departed Germany on Wednesday and will arrive in several days, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The Biden administration is resisting comparisons to Afghanistan, where U.S. troops last year helped evacuate more than 100,000 people in the chaos after the fall of Kabul. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the United States, which is advising American citizens to leave Ukraine, “does not typically do mass evacuations.” “The situation in Afghanistan was unique for many reasons, including that it was the end of a 20-year war. We were bringing a war to an end; we were not trying to prevent a war, as we are certainly in this case.” The Kremlin is demanding a sweeping rewrite of the post-Cold War European security order, including a permanent ban on Ukraine joining NATO and the removal of the bloc’s forces from Eastern Europe. Washington and its allies have ruled out ending NATO’s “open-door” policy, though they have offered to negotiate on issues Moscow deems of “secondary” importance. “What we need to see is real diplomacy, not coercive diplomacy,” Britain’s Johnson said in a statement Thursday. “As an alliance we must draw lines in the snow and be clear there are principles upon which we will not compromise. That includes the security of every NATO ally and the right of every European democracy to aspire to NATO membership.” Dixon reported from Moscow, Hudson from Washington and Pannett from Sydney.

134,2022-02-10,London Metropolitan Police’s first female commissioner resigns amid scandals ," LONDON — Cressida Dick, the first woman to lead London’s Metropolitan Police since its founding in 1829, announced her resignation on Thursday, leaving behind a force that has been criticized for officer misbehavior and for being slow to investigate government parties during pandemic lockdowns. In a statement, Dick said it was with “huge sadness” that she was quitting the commissioner post she has held since 2017 but that London Mayor Sadiq Khan made it clear he “no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership” and “left me no choice but to step aside.” The Metropolitan Police last month launched an investigation of a dozen parties — some held at the prime minister’s Downing Street office, some at his official residence and some at the Cabinet Office — for possible criminal violations of the government’s own coronavirus restrictions. But the scandal has been simmering since November, and critics say the police should have gotten involved much sooner. A late January survey by Ipsos found that less than half of Britons had confidence that the police would conduct a thorough and independent investigation that would result in any penalties. Trust in the force took an especially big hit after a London police officer was convicted of the rape and murder of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who had been on her way home. “The murder of Sarah Everard and many other awful cases recently have, I know, damaged confidence in this fantastic police service,” Dick said Thursday. London police were also heavily criticized for acting in a heavy-handed manner at a vigil for Everard, but the force was later cleared by a police watchdog. One of the defining images from the vigil was of Patsy Stevenson, a women’s rights activist who was pinned to the ground by male police officers. She tweeted on Thursday evening: “Seeya.” But it may have been a recent report on officers sharing misogynistic, homophobic and racist messages that doomed the commissioner. A watchdog investigation found that 14 officers in the Charing Cross station shared dozens of messages, including one where a policeman joked about raping women at knifepoint. Another officer posted an attempt at a joke about using African children to make dog food. Two of the officers were dismissed for gross misconduct, but most have remained on the force. Upon release of the report 10 days ago, Home Secretary Priti Patel, who oversees domestic security, said, “Being a police officer is a privilege which has been abused by these sickening officers.” Patel said, “It has been clear for some time that there are problems with the culture of the Metropolitan Police.” She said she expected the mayor and commissioner to quickly implement the recommendations of the report. “The public rightly expects the behavior of the police to be beyond reproach — standards must be raised,” she said. Khan said in a statement Thursday that he had communicated to the police commissioner the “scale of the change I believe is urgently required to rebuild the trust and confidence of Londoners in the Met and to root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exists.” “I am not satisfied with the Commissioner’s response,” he said. “On being informed of this, Dame Cressida Dick has said she will be standing aside.” Dick will remain on the job for “a short period” while a new commissioner is appointed — and so it remains possible that her officers will conclude their investigation into Downing Street gatherings while she is still in command and while Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fate is still up in the air. The government’s health secretary, Sajid Javid, thanked Dick for her service and called her job one of the “most difficult” in the country.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3BdWOrQ,europe
135,2022-02-10,"Officers charged in George Floyd’s killing omitted key details from the scene, Minneapolis officer testifies"," ST. PAUL, Minn. — Two of the former Minneapolis police officers on trial over charges that they violated George Floyd’s civil rights omitted key details of the fatal arrest, including that Floyd had lost a pulse and was no longer breathing, according to video footage shown in court Thursday. The footage, shown publicly for the first time, came from a body camera worn by former officer Thomas K. Lane. The clip, presented in court by prosecutors, showed Lane and J. Alexander Kueng explaining what had happened to Lt. Richard Zimmerman, the longtime head of the department’s homicide division who had been dispatched to the scene to investigate. The video showed Lane and Kueng, two rookie officers who were the first to encounter Floyd at the  scene, standing near their squad car around 10 p.m. on May 25, 2020. The video was taken about 90 minutes after Floyd, unconscious and without a pulse, had been taken from the scene in an ambulance. Zimmerman approached the officers and asked what was “going on.” Lane and Kueng, often talking over one another, explained how they had responded to a 911 call about the alleged passing of a counterfeit bill and had taken Floyd into custody. Lane repeatedly noted Floyd’s behavior — stating that he thought the man “was on something” and acting “paranoid.” They told Zimmerman that Floyd resisted being placed into a squad car. “He was fighting the whole time,” Lane told Zimmerman. The officers said that Floyd had complained of claustrophobia, and that Lane had offered to roll down the windows of the squad car and sit with him in hopes of getting the man to comply. “He just kind of just started going nuts,” Lane said in the video. “Violently shaking around,” Kueng added. He told Zimmerman that Floyd had pushed his way out to the other side of the squad car and injured his face, prompting Lane to call an ambulance to the scene. “We decided to keep him pinned to the ground,” Kueng said. According to the video, neither Kueng nor Lane told Zimmerman how long Floyd was held to the ground, or how he was restrained. They also omitted that Floyd had lost a pulse. “He was yelling a lot. … He was normal for about three or four minutes, and then he stopped talking,” Kueng told Zimmerman, according to the video. “He was still breathing,” Lane interjected, adding that the ambulance “took off” with Floyd. They told Zimmerman they had no information about Floyd’s condition, even though Lane had boarded the ambulance and failed to revive the man by performing chest compressions. Zimmerman, a 41-year veteran who is the longest-serving officer on the Minneapolis force, told a prosecutor that Kueng and Lane made no mention of Derek Chauvin pressing his knees into Floyd’s neck and back or how the man lost a pulse. He said he only learned the full circumstances at the scene when he later watched video of the incident. “What they told me and what was on the video is totally different,” Zimmerman testified. The longtime officer, who also testified in Chauvin’s state murder trial, said Kueng, Lane and Tou Thao, another officer at the scene, violated the department’s duty-to-intervene policy by not putting an end to Chauvin’s force and failed to render medical aid to those in need as officers are sworn by duty to do. “When you see that somebody is in need of medical aid … you intervene,” Zimmerman testified. “And by that, I mean, you have to take an action. … Push an officer off a person if that’s the case. But you have to take an action.” But defense attorneys tried to impeach Zimmerman’s testimony, questioning him about different statements he made to the FBI and other investigators in the weeks after Floyd’s death — including a claim that Kueng and Lane asked if they should turn off their body cameras before speaking with him, which Thomas Plunkett, an attorney for Kueng, called “untrue.” Zimmerman stood by that statement, saying it wasn’t reflected on footage shown in court. Plunkett also raised questions about whether Zimmerman had violated department policy by speaking to Kueng and Lane at the scene because of policy around critical incidents that limit interactions between officers involved in such incidents and other police personnel. “The policy dictates involved officers should not talk to anyone at the scene except the incident commander or legal counsel,” Plunkett said. “You shouldn’t have even been asking them questions about this case.” The back-and-forth came as prosecutors signaled they are beginning to wind down their case after 11 days of testimony from witnesses including police officers, medical experts and bystanders at the scene of Floyd’s death. A federal grand jury indicted Chauvin, Kueng, Lane and Thao in May on charges that they violated Floyd’s constitutional rights when he was restrained and handcuffed facedown on a South Minneapolis street during an investigation of an alleged counterfeit $20 bill. Kueng, Lane and Thao were charged with failing to render medical aid to Floyd. Kueng and Thao were also charged with violating Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure by not intervening as Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck and back. Kueng, Lane and Thao have each pleaded not guilty. All three have signaled through their attorneys that they will place the blame for Floyd’s death on Chauvin, who was convicted in April on state charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and sentenced to 22½ years in prison. They have also signaled they plan to put the policies, culture and training of the MPD on trial — with Plunkett suggesting that the police department not only failed Floyd, but his client as well. Chauvin pleaded guilty last month to separate federal charges that he violated Floyd’s constitutional rights when he knelt on the man’s neck and back for 9 minutes 29 seconds, as Floyd begged for breath. Chauvin is still awaiting sentencing in that case and could be called as a witness in the case against the other officers. Kueng and Lane had been full-time officers for less than a week when they encountered Floyd, as they responded to a 911 call about a counterfeit $20 bill that had been passed at Cup Foods, a local market. Body-camera video from the scene showed Lane pull a gun on Floyd within 15 seconds of encountering the man in a parked car, without announcing who he was or what he was investigating. Chauvin arrived on the scene a few minutes later with Thao, as Lane and Kueng struggled to place Floyd, who was handcuffed, inside a squad car. Body-camera video shows Floyd complaining of claustrophobia and ultimately being placed facedown on a city street, with Chauvin pressing his knees into Floyd’s neck and back, Kueng atop Floyd’s back and Lane holding the man’s legs. Thao stood a few feet away, pushing back bystanders who increasingly pressed the officers to get off Floyd as he began to lose consciousness. Video shows Floyd complained at least 25 times of not being able to breathe — cries the officers dismissed even as the man went limp. Lawyers for Kueng and Lane have argued that their clients were taking cues from Chauvin, a 19-year member of the department, who had been Kueng’s field training officer and informally advised Lane during his probation period. Lane, who was holding Floyd’s legs, twice asked Chauvin whether they should reposition Floyd — requests that his lawyer says prove he tried to intervene with a senior officer but was rebuffed. Kueng later checked Floyd’s pulse — twice telling Chauvin that he couldn’t detect the man’s heartbeat. But Chauvin did not remove his knees from Floyd’s body until nudged by a responding paramedic. Two Minneapolis police officers — including one who oversaw all of the department’s training and another who specifically trained officers on CPR and other medical knowledge — have testified that Kueng, Lane and Thao violated their training and oaths as officers when they did not stop Chauvin and failed render medical aid. But defense attorneys have suggested their clients were given conflicting training on use of force and were not given adequate scenario training on intervention policies and how to operate in a militarized environment in which younger officers are strongly discouraged from disagreeing with senior officers. Before the clip from Lane’s body camera was played for the court, prosecutor Samantha Trepel displayed for the jury the MPD’s policy on “truthfulness” and asked Zimmerman to read it aloud. “Why does the Minneapolis Police Department have a policy on being truthful?” Trepel asked. “It’s the cornerstone of police work,” Zimmerman replied. “You need truthfulness to be able to assess what your situation is.” Asked if he felt the truthfulness policy applied when he was speaking to Kueng and Lane, the detective replied, “Yes.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3Bcwuyh,national
136,2022-02-10,"Prices climbed 7.5% in January, compared with last year, continuing inflation’s fastest pace in 40 years"," Prices continued their upward march in January, rising at an annual rate of 7.5 percent, the fastest pace in 40 years, as pandemic inflation continues to defy expectations, climbing faster and lasting longer than nearly anyone would have guessed. Inflation had been expected to climb relative to last January, when the economy reeled from a winter coronavirus surge before widespread availability of vaccines.  The cumulative price increases of a chaotic 2021 also were evident. But Thursday’s release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also hit new and surprising high notes: Electricity bills saw their fastest monthly increase in 16 years, and a rapid rise in the cost of baked goods, including cupcakes and cookies, led most food prices higher. The January inflation report reflects an economy still wracked by virus variants and supply chain upheaval, a stark contrast to the promises from the White House, Federal Reserve and economists that 2022 would ring in a new era of normalcy, throwing off the shackles of transient price gains. However, as the omicron variant subsides and vaccination rates rise, the hope is that inflation will begin to drift downward. Many economists and business leaders predict price growth will peak in the next few months and inflation will begin what could be a long descent back to normal, assuming new variants of the coronavirus don’t jolt the recovery’s overall trajectory. “Inflation is still hot, and obviously uncomfortably high, but it’s at its peak, and as the pandemic winds down, as supply chains iron themselves out, inflation will moderate,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Zandi said “it’s not going to be a straight line back” to more sustainable levels of inflation. But his prediction is that “each new wave is less disruptive than the previous one, and as that continues, it’s very encouraging.” Annual inflation numbers are likely to slow in coming months. That’s in part because the yearly comparisons will no longer include the effect of all the supply chain disruptions and massive stimulus of early 2021. Still, monthly price growth remains unsustainably high — prices jumped 0.6 percent from December to January — although many hope that the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates in March could begin to cool prices down. The January inflation report raised fears that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to hike interest rates at its next meeting, driving major financial markets lower Thursday and pushing up bond yields. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for households and businesses to borrow money, which slows spending and can cool off a hot economy and curb price growth. Indeed, increases in the cost of food, electricity and shelter helped drive inflation higher in January with household furnishings, clothing and medical care becoming costlier, while used-car costs continued to spiral upward, albeit at a slower pace than in prior months. “I’m worried,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. She agrees that inflation could slow in the next few months but warns that it might be difficult to bring price growth down to pre-pandemic levels. “The Fed is counting on inflation abating somewhat on its own,” Swonk said. “The problem is that even as inflation abates, it may not cool enough not to burn. Some of the inflation we are seeing is becoming more entrenched in the service sector. There is no playbook for derailing inflation in this environment.” The White House has touted its efforts to lower prices, including targeting corporate consolidation to help create more competitive markets. On Thursday, President Biden pointed to the economy’s bright spots — historic economic growth, a drop in weekly unemployment claims, wage increases — as successes amid such high inflation. “We have seen historic success on the first priority, with the greatest year of job growth in history, Americans finding better jobs, better wages, and better benefits, along with the fastest economic growth in decades,” Biden said in a statement. “On higher prices, we have been using every tool at our disposal, and while today is a reminder that Americans’ budgets are being stretched in ways that create real stress at the kitchen table, there are also signs that we will make it through this challenge.” But inflation has proved to be a blistering political handicap for Biden and a litmus test for the way many Americans judge the economy. Republicans largely blame Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan for overheating the economy, and the GOP is set to hammer on inflation going into the midterm elections this fall. “Joe Biden’s economy has Americans drowning in record-high inflation,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). “People in Wyoming are now paying sky-high prices for gas, groceries, heating bills and rent. As a result, they are having to change how they live while Democrat-driven inflation keeps eating away at their paychecks.” Despite inflation, there are signs that strong wage growth and generous federal aid have helped workers stay ahead of rising prices since the pandemic began. And while workers have fallen behind in recent months, some economists expect workers to come out ahead, again, as inflation falls. “It’s very likely that the prices will come down faster than wages,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist of the Economic Outlook Group. “And what that means, of course, is that companies will suffer narrower profit margins than they did last year.” As inflation spread throughout the economy, several categories posted their largest monthly price increases ever, including tires, vending machines and frozen foods. Compared with 2021, the energy index rose 27 percent, and food rose 7 percent. The cost of food rose in January, compared with December, with cereals and baked goods increasing the most. Fruits and vegetables also edged up. John Sayles, chief executive of the Vermont Foodbank, said that before the pandemic, the group’s produce distribution program helped about 250 families in a part of rural Vermont. That has grown to around 600 families, many of whom are also struggling with higher heating oil and propane costs in the winter. “Food insecurity is really financial insecurity,” Sayles said. “Of all the families we see, very few have zero income. It’s really a matter of where that income goes. … People are looking for any strategy that’s out there to be able to tie those ends together at the end of the month.” Rent prices jumped again in January, climbing at a slightly faster pace than in the previous two months. Economists have been especially worried about rising home and rent costs, which can get locked in through long-term contracts and may not improve after supply chains clear up. The overall sharp price growth has undermined an otherwise robust recovery. Even after accounting for inflation, the economy in 2021 recorded its fastest growth since 1984. Over the past 12 months, the U.S. economy has added nearly 7 million jobs, and average hourly earnings have climbed 5.7 percent. Yet high inflation has left an indelible mark on the economy, including the highest price increases for housing, food and energy that many workers have ever seen. And questions loom about how or whether policymakers will be able to rein prices back in without slowing the recovery or even causing another recession. The answers will have enormous implications for policymakers at the Federal Reserve and in the Biden administration. All signs suggest that the Federal Reserve, which is in charge of keeping prices stable, will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in March. On Thursday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Bloomberg News that he would like to see rates increase a full percentage point by July, which would be considered aggressive. Momentum in the job market, combined with soaring inflation, has pushed Fed officials to suggest they plan to raise interest rates higher and faster than officials previously anticipated. The Fed is expected to end its sprawling asset purchase program next month and to raise rates multiple times in 2022, with some analysts predicting as many as five hikes. Fed officials maintain they expect inflation will fall later this year, especially if supply chains clear their backlogs and consumer demand eases to more normal levels. “There are multiple forces which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down,” Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said last month. “We do realize that the timing and pace of that are, are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we thought. And, of course, we’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched.” Swonk, the economist, said she is worried it might already be too late. “The Fed doesn’t have a good record of derailing an actual surge in inflation without rate hikes bleeding into the unemployment,” she said. As wages rise, inflation may already be getting entrenched into the economy. Colgate-Palmolive, which sells toothpaste, pet food, soap and more, recently announced price hikes to cover soaring costs. Chief executive Noel Wallace said on a recent earnings call that he expected the price of raw materials to peak in the first three months of the year and that the company would be able to increase profits later in the year as recent price hikes took effect and raw-material costs began to fall. Because prices are rising everywhere, Wallace said, there is a lower risk of customers switching to a cheaper competitor. Houston-based Sysco, a major supplier of food for restaurants, hospitals and other institutions, has stayed in strong financial shape despite double-digit growth in food prices. It has been able to charge customers more while winning significant new business with its lower-cost products. On a recent earnings call, Aaron Alt, the firm’s chief financial officer, was asked whether inflation had peaked. He demurred. “We are continuing to see elevated levels of inflation. And as much as I would like to call when the down point will be,” Alt said, it’s “impossible for us to do.” At the very least, he said, he expects inflation to remain elevated through June. Economists say the economy has a long way to go before prices settle back to what’s considered typical inflation. The pandemic economy has been anything but predictable, and new coronavirus variants have weighed on supply chains, raised workers’ exposure risk to the virus and complicated households’ ability to find child care. “It doesn’t happen this year, it just doesn’t, and I think everyone needs to be honest about that,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain. “[The Fed] is talking a big game, but they’ve had the foot on the accelerator for years now, and they haven’t done anything yet.”   ",Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/10/cpi-inflation-january/,economy
137,2022-02-10,Seals are dying in droves along South Africa’s coast. What’s killing them remains a mystery.," WESTERN CAPE, South Africa — The tourist, in her sandals, flower-print shirt and floppy sun hat, was concentrating on keeping a sure footing. The boulders on this desolately beautiful stretch of coastline were jagged and slippery. Then, she looked up. Before her was a breathtakingly grisly scene: six dead seals lined up in a row, one splayed open to reveal its inner workings, bright red blood collecting in pools and trickling down to the crashing waves below. A motley crew of younger women huddled over the carcasses. But the tourist didn’t seem fazed. “What a shame,” she said. “Pardon me for being nosy, but do you know what’s killing them?” Tess Gridley, a scientist who doesn’t study seals normally but has taken it upon herself to find out what’s been killing thousands of the animals along southern Africa’s Atlantic coast over the past six months, looked between the tourist and dead seals in front of her. “That’s what we’re trying to figure out,” Gridley said. The seals were some of more than 50 she has necropsied on the region’s beaches. Marine species on the coasts around Cape Town are facing multiple crises. A bird flu outbreak last year took out nearly a fifth of an endangered cormorant population in South Africa. Local penguin numbers are declining precipitously, in part because overfishing is depleting their sources of food. Further north, in Angola, fish stocks are plummeting as climate change rapidly warms the ocean. But seals? Who cares about seals? Most fishermen certainly don’t — the mischievous creatures snack on their catch. And while they may be cute, they aren’t endangered, not even close. Furthermore, seal mortality is famously high — as much as 40 percent of pups don’t survive. So who’s to say that the current die-off is even abnormal? Gridley, 40, is convinced this is abnormal, and a mystery worth solving that has potential implications reaching far beyond seals. “Seals are just gone from whole areas of coast, and no one has batted an eye,” she said. “I’m filling a gap because it seems nobody else will.” It is understandable why endangered bird populations get attention. Bird flu can jump to mammal populations and, at worst, turn into a pandemic. More commonly, it can infect poultry and ostriches, both of which factor heavily into the South African diet and economy. But Gridley’s leading theory for what’s killing the seals is also a toxin that in high concentrations can pose a threat to humans and their food. Domoic acid, released in some algae blooms, is ingested by plankton and then moves up the food chain through shellfish and anchovies and so on. In humans, it can cause what is called amnesic shellfish poisoning, which, as the name suggests, primarily affects memory, but also balance, and can be fatal. Domoic acid poisoning has been linked in peer-reviewed studies to  sea lion die-offs in California. In some instances, the animals were seen stumbling, bewildered, along coastal roads, their memory and balance seemingly gone. “There are huge parallels” between California and South Africa, said Frances Gulland, commissioner of the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission. “And that’s concerning in part because the economic impacts were massive in California. When domoic acid spiked in samples, the whole shellfish industry shut down for months.” In the late 1990s, Gulland and other researchers faced a similar mystery to Gridley’s, but publicity and public interest in the sea lion die-off led to a spate of funding for research that ultimately proved domoic acid’s treacherous but largely invisible threat to marine populations. It also helped describe how warming waters and increased agricultural runoff led to more harmful algal blooms. Through a U.S. government-funded program called Mussel Watch, California now regularly tests ocean water and marine organisms for domoic acid and other toxins, and has tied the legality of seafood harvests and sales to toxin levels found in those samples.  South Africa lacks that kind of long-term study, said Grant Pitcher, a specialist scientist at the South African government’s fisheries, forests and environment department. The capacity to test for the toxin is also unavailable in South Africa. Much of the suspicion that domoic acid is to blame in South Africa is based on odd behavior by South African seals similar to what was seen in California before they die, Pitcher said. “We know the same problematic species producing toxins predominate here as in California, and the timing of algae blooms has coincided with the seals dying,” he said. “As for the seals dying, we really don’t have much monitoring or sampling beyond what Tess is doing.” Gridley is systematically trying to get to the bottom of South Africa’s seal die-off, roping in veterinarians, algae experts and chemists who donate their spare time. Gridley and her husband are whale and dolphin experts — Gridley focuses on bioacoustics, how those animals communicate — and are largely self-funding the seal work with the help of online donations. Gridley’s 77-year-old father takes quasi-forensic photos of the dead seals. Interns lug equipment and label jars of seal organs preserved in formaldehyde for testing later on. She’s largely taught herself how to cut open a seal, and brings some of them, kept cool on bags of ice, to her home outside Cape Town, where necropsies are easier than among the boulders. “My kids are so tired of dead seals,” she said, wincing. “They are so over it.” The die-off began last September. High tides coughed up dozens of dead seals per mile. Even if many people along the coast have mixed feelings about seals, it has been a shocking — and pungent — event. Concerned citizens eventually found Gridley, most via social media, where Gridley’s nonprofit, Sea Search, is active. “I walk a lot along the beach with my dogs,” said Marianne Franck, 70, a recent retiree. “One day, I found 40 of the dead seals. They were on top of each other, just, like, you know, dumped there. Oh, the stench! And the maggots! And the pups who had survived crying like little lambs. And all you can do is just say goodbye.” A regular Monday morning for Gridley now includes receiving a stream of images of dead seals from vigilant volunteers up and down the coastline. She might then go survey one stretch or the other. Some days there are dozens of carcasses, some fresh, others picked up by beach cleaners and left in wheelbarrows with plastic bags over their heads, yet more presumably swept back into the sea by large swells. The particular kind of seal that’s been dying — the Cape fur seal — is thought to number around 2 million. Their large population contributes to the lack of urgency in studying them. Funding around the cormorant die-off, for instance, has been easier to come by. “We’ve been able to do PCR tests on hundreds of the birds,” said David Roberts, a clinical veterinarian at the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds. The government has also participated more actively. Thousands of sick cormorants were euthanized before they could pass along the flu, many of them by having their necks manually broken before being discarded in garbage bags. There were days last September when more than 500 were being found dead, Roberts said. “Seals are much harder to handle. You need a big truck, multiple people to carry them, maybe even a stretcher,” he said. “If the seals had been dying of bird flu, it would have been emergency. But we don’t think that’s the case.” Proving domoic acid poisoning is a particularly difficult endeavor anywhere, but especially in South Africa. The acid disappears from a dead animal within hours of death, so freshly dead specimens are essential. Even with volunteers sending images, luck plays a huge part in the process. The acid also causes the seals to vomit, which can decrease the presence of the acid in the stomach, making it harder to find. Because there are no testing facilities in South Africa, Gridley has planned on sending some of her preserved samples to Britain or the United States. Brains and other organs require permits to ship internationally because they are animal parts, but seal feces can be sent without one. (“Sending poo, well, that’s easy!” she remarked, excitedly.) The likelihood that one factor — domoic acid, in this case — is solely to blame is unlikely. With climate change and overfishing dramatically reshaping marine ecosystems, the answer is almost always multifactorial. “We have to be really sure its domoic acid before we say that publicly,” said Gridley. “It has the potential to cause real alarm, so we’re not rushing to any conclusions.” Due diligence likely means at least dozens more necropsies. It is not just grim work, but it is hard. On a recent, blazingly hot morning, Gridley clambered among the boulders bleached white by gull droppings toward two seals lying motionless. One was just in a deep slumber, and bolted awake, as if from a dream, to find an equally shocked human peering at it. The other, however, was dead. Gridley and three interns dragged it toward the shade of a boulder, holding it by its fins and neck skin. They laid it next to five others. “Okay, ladies, let’s get systematic about this. Lay them out in order of freshness,” she said, gravely. And then, knife in hand, to herself: “Alright Tess, just get this done.” ",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3uB7Upz,africa
138,2022-02-10,"Some Trump records taken to Mar-a-Lago clearly marked as classified, including documents at ‘top secret’ level"," Some of the White House documents that Donald Trump improperly took to his Mar-a-Lago residence were clearly marked as classified, including documents at the “top secret” level, according to two people familiar with the matter. The existence of clearly marked classified documents in the trove — which has not previously been reported — is likely to intensify the legal pressure that Trump or his staffers could face, and raises new questions about why the materials were taken out of the White House. While it was unclear how many classified documents were among those received by the National Archives and Records Administration, some bore markings that the information was extremely sensitive and would be limited to a small group of officials with authority to view such highly classified information, the two people familiar with the matter said. The markings were discovered by the National Archives, which last month arranged for the collection of 15 boxes of documents from the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence. Archives officials asked the Justice Department to look into the matter, though as of Thursday afternoon FBI agents had yet to review the materials, according to two people familiar with the request. It remained unclear whether the Justice Department would launch a full-fledged investigation. The files were being stored in a sensitive compartmented information facility, also known as an SCIF, while Justice Department officials debated how to proceed, the two people familiar with the matter said. Like others in this story, the people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a politically sensitive matter. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said: “It is clear that a normal and routine process is being weaponized by anonymous, politically motivated government sources to peddle Fake News. The only entity with the ability to credibly dispute this false reporting, the National Archives, is providing no comment.” Trump’s years-long defiance of the Presidential Records Act, which requires the preservation of memos, letters, notes, emails, faxes and other written communications related to a president’s official duties, and other unusual record-keeping practices have long drawn scrutiny. In 2018, for example, Politico reported on his penchant for ripping up official documents. But in recent weeks, Trump’s activities have generated new attention — in large part because of the House select committee’s investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Washington Post reported late last month that some of the White House records the National Archives turned over to the committee appeared to have been torn apart and then taped back together. The Post later reported that officials had recovered 15 boxes of presidential records from Mar-a-Lago, and that they suspected Trump had possibly violated laws concerning the handling of government documents — including those that might be considered classified. A “top secret” classification is applied to information where unauthorized disclosure “could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security,” according to the Archives’s Information Security Oversight Office. Officials even keep secret some of the mechanics of how the government categorizes and stores its secrets, but in daily practice often refer to classified systems as “the high side” and unclassified government systems as “the low side.” On the high side, there are different types of classified information within “top secret” that are restricted to smaller groups of officials on a need-to-know basis, including a broad category referred to as Special Access Programs, or SAP. Even with documents marked classified found where they don’t belong, prosecutors have a high legal bar to get to criminal charges. Prosecutors would have to prove someone intentionally mishandled the material or was grossly negligent in doing so — which can be a steep hurdle in its own right. And Trump, as president, would have had unfettered latitude to declassify material, potentially raising even bigger challenges to bringing a case against him. Former federal prosecutor Brandon Van Grack said that some of the laws about classified information require someone to act “without authorization, and potentially the president would be able to argue he gave himself that authorization.” But — regardless of whether a criminal case could be substantiated — Van Grack said that “the FBI would want and need to review the information and conduct an investigation to determine what occurred and whether any sources and methods were compromised.” It is not precisely clear who packed up the classified materials at Mar-a-Lago, or how they got there in the first place. Trump was very secretive about the packing of boxes that were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago last month, and did not let other aides — including some of his most senior advisers — look at them, according to people close to him. During his time in the White House, Trump often took official documents with him to his residence to review, accruing piles of records over time, according to people familiar with Trump’s record-keeping practices. Although that is not in itself necessarily unusual, the documents would pile up. One White House staffer said it became a problem that eventually led records staff to search for materials in classified burn bags, which are used to dispose of documents. “For all the things written about him that he didn’t read, he often would take things with him to the residence or bring things down with him,” said a second Trump White House official. “But I don’t know that that is out of the ordinary.” Officials had to scramble to pack up before Joe Biden took office, and one person familiar with the events surmised that some of the documents from the residence likely made their way into boxes destined for Mar-a-Lago rather than being turned over as they should have been. One adviser said Trump began reviewing materials in December after staff received the requests from Gary Stern, a longtime Archives lawyer. Over the summer, the Archives reached out about high-profile documents that did not seem to be among those turned over, a person familiar with the matter said. Those included correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that Trump once described as “love letters,” as well as a letter left for Trump by President Barack Obama, the person said. The National Archives also inquired about a map of Hurricane Dorian that had been altered with a black marker by Trump in a failed attempt to show he had not been wrong about the storm’s path, the person said. Last month, Archives officials retrieved those and the other boxes, and the Archives said in a statement that Trump representatives were “continuing to search” for additional records that have yet to be turned over. David Laufman, a former Justice Department counterintelligence official who was involved in prosecutions and investigations over the mishandling of classified information, said Trump being a former president “presents additional litigation risk factors, insofar as he, as president, would have had the authority to declassify documents or potentially even determine where classified documents could be transferred.” But, he added, “there’s no question that it was improper for classified information to be taken to or to reside at Mar-a-Lago.” Laufman, who was involved in the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, said a Justice Department investigation would focus not just on Trump but also on those who packed up the classified materials and moved them to Mar-a-Lago, and whether they knew what they were doing. He said the next step would be for the FBI to go to the secure facility where the documents were being stored, review the markings for themselves, and then “to broaden its investigation to learn how these documents came to be taken from the White House to Mar-a-Lago and whether anybody associated with that bears potential criminal liability.” Former presidents do sometimes receive and hold on to classified information, according to people familiar with presidential records. For example, former presidents might receive classified briefing documents in advance of a meeting with a foreign leader. But they are supposed to carefully safeguard such documents, keeping them in a safe or other secure facility. If a record has been labeled “top secret,” federal rules spell out a procedure for their handling and for any effort to declassify them. Often the information does not originate from the White House but from another agency. In the past, when there has been discussion of declassifying a military or intelligence record, the originating agency is consulted about whether a document should be declassified. The rules also require that declassified documents be marked visibly as “declassified.” One added wrinkle to the questions swirling around the Trump records is that while he was president, Trump frequently stayed at Mar-a-Lago and handled official documents while there, meaning it could be difficult in some instances to establish the chain of custody of specific classified documents. The concern that the former president or his inner circle may have brought classified documents to an unsecure location provides a potential line of political attack for critics of Trump, who during the 2016 campaign repeatedly railed against Clinton for her handling of classified material and insisted she should be in jail. The FBI investigated Clinton for possibly mishandling classified information in connection with her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Investigators found 110 emails that contained classified information at the time they were sent or received in the group of 30,000 that Clinton later turned over for review, including eight email chains that contained information that was “top secret” at the time they were sent. But the Justice Department ultimately decided not to charge Clinton, after the FBI determined it could not prove she intended to mishandle sensitive material. Some analysts said Trump could now find himself in the crosshairs of a similar probe. But others urged caution. “There are just a ton of unknowns here,” Van Grack said. “So part of this is, people just need to not jump to conclusions.” Tom Hamburger and Ashley Parker contributed to this report.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3rIHuk0,politics
139,2022-02-10,"The  ‘Great Reshuffle’: A costly, ineffective fix for understaffed schools, hospitals and businesses"," Every job has some “and other duties as needed” expectations that fall outside the official description. With layoffs, illnesses, resignations and other losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, many desperate employers are leaning heavily on that “other duties” clause to fill staffing gaps, asking employees to handle additional tasks that are significantly different from their daily jobs. As schools nationwide close for lack of staff and faculty during the omicron-variant surge, state and local administrative employees and even National Guard personnel are being asked to step in. Last month, the governor of New Mexico signed up for a rotation as a substitute teacher. I’ve seen school newsletters in my Northern Virginia district inviting parents and other community members to sign up as substitute teachers, cafeteria workers and school bus drivers. Many of the burned-out educators who have vacated those teaching positions are moving to IT, health care, software development and corporate training. Most are securing jobs with much higher pay and better work-life balance than they had as teachers. As someone coming from a family of teachers, I’d be the last to blame them. Teaching today demands not just advanced degrees, but also mastery of constantly shifting bureaucratic protocols and government-mandated curriculums. It also requires the ability to accommodate hundreds of individual students’ needs. Job swaps are taking place in other industries as well. A friend of mine, who is an IT professional at a major health-care facility, volunteered for alternative duty and was assigned several shifts supporting the kitchen staff in preparing meals for patients. (My friend asked to remain unnamed because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the organization.) Other colleagues, he said, were tapped to be runners, providing general support to staff and patients. My friend and his colleagues are generally happy to help; the rotations are infrequent and voluntary, and they’re still being paid their higher IT salaries. But even volunteers will draw the line if they feel that they are taken advantage of. A Chicago IT supervisor said she and other senior personnel signed on to help cover hardware maintenance at the start of the pandemic, thinking it would be for just a few weeks. “We all lived close [to the office] and wanted to help out,” she said in an email, on condition of anonymity because she’s still in the industry. After a year, the supervisor said, she stopped volunteering when she heard that the original workers had threatened to get their union involved if the company tried to force them into the office during the pandemic. As a result, the original workers were allowed to work fewer hours from home at their full rate of pay, while higher-paid colleagues covered the majority of their work at the office. Bringing in substitutes is also costly. In the cases previously mentioned, employers are pulling internal volunteers from higher-salary brackets. When that goes on indefinitely, something has to give: The higher-wage work gets neglected or the higher-wage earners get burned out trying to cover two jobs. When the work is performed by a mix of regulars and substitutes, it can cost even more. In health care, full-time nurses are working alongside traveling nurses who make as much as three times their salary. Nurses’ unions have asserted that hospitals would not need to spend more in times of crisis if they maintained adequate full-time staff and paid them better. Finally, hiring fill-in workers won’t help if the problems that led to vacancies in the first place aren’t resolved. T.J. Boaz, a former paralegal in Scottsdale, Ariz., quit after being ordered to step in for two mailroom employees who had contracted the coronavirus. Boaz had helped out in the mailroom before on occasion, but last year decided that the risk of coronavirus exposure was too great. “There were too many anti-vaxxers not masking in the office and covid was becoming rampant,” Boaz said in an email. This “Great Reshuffle” is not a sustainable long-term solution. Granted, improving standard pay and working conditions to retain and attract more workers, while the obvious fix in concept, is complicated in practice. But diverting higher-paid employees and bringing in expensive temps is not cost-effective, and hiring hastily trained replacements undermines the quality of the work. This is especially true in jobs in which vulnerable clients depend on trained and dedicated professionals. When it comes to quality education and health care, there is just no substitute.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3GFD81b,"businessperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
140,2022-02-10,The benefits of vaccinating the world are clear. The catch is the price tag.," You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest, including news from around the globe, interesting ideas, and opinions to know sent to your inbox every weekday. A new model aims to find the cost of vaccinating the world. It could also reveal the huge cost of not vaccinating the world: At least 1 million lives. Researchers from Yale, Brown, the University of Maryland and Stanford, as well as the group Public Citizen, which advocates for improved access to medicines, published the model and its findings in a preprint study Thursday. Their research, which other experts called imperfect but telling, comes amid new pressure on the U.S. government to ensure wider access to coronavirus vaccines using mRNA technology made by U.S. companies Pfizer and Moderna. According to the model, mRNA doses for every person living in lower-middle and low-income countries this year would avert 1.2 million deaths. Third doses for this population, already common in wealthy countries, would avert 1.5 million deaths, the model found. Zain Rizvi, a research director at Public Citizen and one of the authors of the study, said it should be a “wake-up call” for the United States. “President Biden has the opportunity to save a million lives if he were to launch a serious global vaccine manufacturing and delivery programs,” he said. The numbers align with other estimates by global health organizations. Covax, a global vaccination effort backed by the World Health Organization, has publicly estimated that its vaccine deliveries could save between 1 million to 1.27 million lives in 2022. At least 5.7 million people, if not far more, have died. If these numbers are accurate, or even remotely reflective, a rapid scale-up of vaccination in low-income countries could prevent a mammoth number of deaths. And there would be added benefits to increasing vaccination in poorer nations. A separate peer-reviewed study released last month found that if wealthy nations donated half of their vaccines, the world would be far better protected by future variants. But if those are the benefits, what are the costs? Unsurprisingly, it’s cash: Saving lives costs money. And the rich countries that would shoulder the bill aren’t always happy to open up their wallets. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization and its partners announced a new call for funding its ACT-Accelerator, a body designed to alleviate global inequality during the pandemic, with the aim of reaching $23 billion in 2022. Covax, the vaccines pillar of that body, had already launched its own calls for $5.2 billion in funding over the next three months. Many wealthy countries have donated to efforts such as Covax, either giving cash or excess doses. Last November, the Biden administration announced a plan to boost global supply of mRNA vaccines with billions of dollars in funding. But global efforts to fight the coronavirus remain persistently underfunded. And as fears about the pandemic dim in highly vaccinated countries after the wave of omicron variant infections, attention may be elsewhere. High-income countries want to declare victory over the coronavirus, WHO special envoy Ayoade Alakija said at a press briefing this week. “There no such thing as victory over covid. That ship sailed a long time ago,” said Alakija, who also serves as co-chair of the African Union’s African Vaccine Delivery Alliance. The model from Rizvi and his colleagues could show that the price tag for vaccinating the world is lower than many expected. Gregg Gonsalves, a co-author of the study and an associate professor at Yale School of Public Health, said that their research showed global vaccination could come at “an incredibly reasonable price” when considered per life saved. That number, based on estimates for the number of vaccinations as well as estimated production and delivery costs of mRNA vaccines from the WHO and other organizations, varied considerably. At its highest, it would be $81,500 per life saved. At its lowest, $7,400. Either price would be considerably lower estimates used by the U.S. federal government to show the monetary value of a single life — more than $10 million in one estimate. The paper has not been peer-reviewed and some modeling experts who were shown it by Today’s WorldView noted there were many more complications it did not consider, including the impact of widespread levels of immunity in poorer nations that had large omicron outbreaks. Another additional factor was the added cost of scaling up production so quickly. One study released earlier this year estimated an additional 15 billion doses of mRNA vaccines would need to be manufactured this year to deal with omicron — far above current models. “It’s a scratch model,” Gonsalves explained, adding that the range of complications meant there was little “bang for the buck” in more complicated models that would not change the underlying point. And that underlying point has long been hard to argue with. Last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a proposal for ending covid-19 using vaccination, along with other measures, at $50 billion. The model released Thursday hit on similar price tags, ranging from $35 billion to $61 billion. The benefits for human life are obvious. But there are economic benefits, too. The IMF’s 2021 estimate suggested that the global economy could gain $9 trillion under its proposal. Reviewing the model, Monica Gandhi, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California at San Francisco who was not involved in the research, said its findings were “important, impactful and a call to action” for countries like the United States that had already spent trillions on their own pandemic response. Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center, said that the success of models in predicting the outcome during this pandemic always depended on what counterfactuals were involved. However, Katz added in an email, given “that many believe that mRNA vaccines will be a critical platform for future vaccines, building global mRNA manufacturing capacity around the world seem like a smart investment” for the future. So far, neither Pfizer or Moderna have agreed to work with a WHO-backed mRNA technology hub in South Africa, which backers say is costing one company reverse engineering a vaccine candidate up to years in development time. In earnings announcements this week, Pfizer announced it forecasts roughly $100 billion in revenue this year.

141,2022-02-10,The history of seat-belt laws shows public health doesn’t have to be partisan," Mask mandates have generated intense fights throughout the pandemic, sparking comparisons to early battles over seat-belt laws, which were similarly divisive when they were introduced in the United States in the 1980s. As they have with masks, opponents initially derided seat belts as uncomfortable and constricting, and they portrayed state laws requiring the restraints as government overreach. “Seat-belt laws steal our freedom,” proclaimed a 1989 editorial. “This has nothing to do with public safety,” another seat-belt law opponent argued in 1986. “It’s personal safety, and people should have the right to choose for themselves.” Yet, there are key differences between seat-belt laws and mask mandates. While the mask requirements started with adults, the first passenger restraint laws in the United States targeted children. And although both seat-belt laws and mask mandates became highly politicized, the state that paved the way for seat-belt requirements in the United States was a relatively conservative state in the South — Tennessee — rather than a more liberal one in the Northeast or the West, where the first mask mandates were passed. Understanding and learning from this history could help make public health measures less polarizing. By the 1970s, most developed countries had adult seat-belt laws, but, despite numerous attempts, no U.S. state had managed to pass similar measures, in large part because car manufacturers had lobbied against them. Everything changed, however, when children became the focus of passenger restraint laws. The efforts of Robert Sanders, a pediatrician in Murfreesboro, Tenn., and his wife, Pat, precipitated this shift. The two were so persistent in meeting with state politicians, including a young Al Gore, about child safety seats that they became known as “Dr. and Mrs. Seat Belt.” Robert Sanders didn’t set out to become involved with public health or politics, but in the 1970s, he was asked to join a state automobile accident prevention committee, and his traffic safety advocacy arose from that work. As a pediatrician, Sanders already knew that car accidents were a leading cause of death among young children in the United States, killing hundreds of toddlers and infants each year. But through the accident prevention committee, he learned about studies that showed child safety seats, which represented new technology at the time, could reduce childhood traffic deaths by up to 90 percent. He became convinced that every child passenger deserved the protection of a car seat, which meant requiring them by law rather than merely encouraging parents to use them. Crucially, the auto industry didn’t oppose child safety seats as vigorously as it did adult seat-belt laws because requiring drivers to use child safety seats — a car accessory — didn’t require anything of auto manufacturers. Politicians and the public also generally accepted laws designed to protect young children more readily than those aimed at adults. Still, although they avoided an auto industry campaign to torpedo their bill, Robert and Pat Sanders encountered plenty of resistance. In an oral history conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2004, the couple recalled one state representative who refused to support the legislation unless a “babes in arms” amendment — allowing parents to hold infants in their laps — was added. The representative had fond memories of watching his son and daughter-in-law drive up to his house with their newborn child in the front seat and didn’t want to deprive other families of that experience. It took the deaths of several infants in accidents while sitting in their caretakers’ laps to get the amendment removed. The Sanderses also remembered that Tennessee Gov. Ray Blanton (D) expressed hesitation about signing the bill until his grandchildren’s pediatrician persuaded him to do so. Other clinicians attended legislative committee meetings about the bill, and Robert Sanders made sure they sat in the front row so they could make eye contact with lawmakers. “That busy physicians would appeal to legislators in regard to a political issue that wasn’t self-serving, except for the safety of little children, was considered refreshing by many Tennessee lawmakers,” he later wrote. The Tennessee child safety seat law went into effect in 1978 and was effective almost immediately, more than doubling car seat usage within the first few years and reducing childhood traffic fatalities by 70 percent. Other states, starting with Rhode Island, passed similar laws shortly thereafter, and by the mid-1980s, every state had some form of child passenger restraint legislation on the books. Adult seat-belt laws followed, starting with New York in 1984. Although a vocal minority objected to them, most Americans accepted the new rules, perhaps because they had already become used to buckling up their children. Car manufacturers also accepted the laws, refocusing their opposition on air bag requirements. The resulting laws have been overwhelmingly successful. In 2022, about 90 percent of American drivers use seat belts, compared to only about 14 percent in the early 1980s, when the first seat-belt laws were passed. Most Americans today instinctively put on a seat belt when they get into a car, and the idea of not wearing one as a political statement, a common occurrence in the 1980s, now seems absurd. Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that seat belts save roughly 15,000 lives per year. Tennessee helped the nation achieve this goal, and the state sees its pioneering role in the history of seat-belt legislation as a point of pride. At a 2008 event commemorating the 30th anniversary of the landmark legislation, then-Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) said: “Tennessee has always been a visionary place, and the people of Tennessee have always known that nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of our children.” Still, while Tennessee continues to have some of the strongest seat belt and child safety seat laws in the country, its leadership in traffic safety has not translated to other areas of public health. For example, Tennessee has some of the highest gun death rates in the country, but it recently passed a permitless carry law, despite objections by local physicians. This past Christmas, a stray bullet killed a 12-year-old boy who, only weeks earlier, had written to Gov. Bill Lee (R) opposing the new law. Further, during the coronavirus pandemic, the state has passed laws that deprived health officials of their authority to close schools and banned most mask mandates. The state’s Department of Health also fired its vaccine director, pediatrician Michelle Fiscus, after she faced political backlash for acknowledging the existence of a 1987 doctrine that allows teenagers to get vaccinated without parental consent. Tennessee has experienced high rates of hospitalizations and deaths because of covid-19 this winter, which experts have attributed to the state’s low vaccination rates. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to assume that Tennessee or other conservative states cannot enact groundbreaking public health policies. After all, support for and opposition to public health measures often span the political spectrum. Massachusetts in the 1980s was one of the first states to mandate seat belts, but voters repealed the law in 1986, and it wasn’t reinstated until 1994. In the 2010s, Mississippi had the highest childhood immunization rates in the United States while vaccine hesitancy caused measles and whooping cough outbreaks in more-liberal states, such as California. Ultimately, public health victories and failures can happen in any state, no matter how progressive or conservative they may seem. Recognizing this and focusing on strategies that broaden support for public health policies could help to depoliticize mask mandates and similar measures in the future.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3stA2s1,"made by historyperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
142,2022-02-10,These police departments want you to celebrate Valentine’s Day by turning in your ex," For many people, February is a month to celebrate love, with couples giving each other flowers, chocolates and stuffed animals. But several police departments are encouraging people to reject romantic tradition and instead turn their exes in this Valentine’s Day. If a former flame wronged you and they happen to have outstanding warrants — or perhaps drugs in their car — the Port Orange Police Department in Florida is standing by and ready to take action. ""Give us a call with their location and we’ll take care of the rest,” the Port Orange Police Department wrote on Facebook Wednesday. At least two other police departments have posted the same message on their Facebook accounts in recent days, including Louisiana’s Lake Arthur Police Department and Georgia’s Rockmart Police. In an unorthodox strategy to encourage the community to come forward with tips, the law enforcement agencies are offering a Valentine’s Day “month-long special.” The “special” includes ""a set of limited-edition platinum bracelets, free transportation with a chauffeur, a one-night minimum stay in luxurious accommodations and professional glamour shots that will be posted on online for all to enjoy,” the post says. It goes on: “We know this special is so incredible that you may be tempted to provide additional referrals. We don’t blame you, this special is too sweet to pass by!” Within a day of being shared by the Port Orange Police Department, the post has been liked and shared thousands of times, with social media users praising its creativity and hilariousness. “Genius!“ one user wrote. “Somebody give this social media manager a raise!” another chimed in. Lisa Remington, a cashier from Edgewater, Fla., was one of those users who weighed in and complimented the post. But she said Thursday she feared that the invitation to submit information about exes could prompt people to act out of spite and revenge without providing solid information. “It might be effective or it could be a little vindictive depending on what the warrant is for,” she told The Washington Post Thursday. Maria Haberfeld, chair of the law and police science department at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, echoed similar concerns and described these types of campaigns as “inappropriate” and warned of the dangers of trivializing criminal conduct. “As much as I am all for a hint of humor inserted into police-community relations, there is nothing funny about people committing crimes,” she told The Post Thursday. Haberfeld said such initiatives could possibly incite people “to provide false information as part of a revenge scheme” and added it could also put the potential informers “on a path of danger, if and when one of the ‘exes’ finds out who provided the police with the information,” she said. Even if there was evidence of similar campaigns leading to prosecutions — which she did not have knowledge of — Haberfeld warned against them, saying the risks “outweigh the potential benefits.” Sgt. William Harrison, interim public information officer at the Port Orange police, said they “copied” the idea — and exact same message — from another county police department in Florida, though he did not specify which department. By Thursday afternoon, he said they have not yet received any solid tips but hoped the public will offer information about “lesser crimes and misdemeanors” including battery, stolen merchandise or vehicles. “But we are open to pretty much anybody with a warrant ready to get picked up,” he said in an interview Thursday. “A warrant about domestic violence would be great.” Harrison said the campaign presented a win-win situation, where the police could get relevant information on people they might not be actively searching for, since he said the department focuses on felony warrants for more serious crimes. “We can’t do our job without the public’s cooperation and we definitely can’t find people without their cooperation, so this is a good way to remind people that we need them,” he said.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3rGDTTf,national
143,2022-02-10,"When schools went virtual, online bullying declined"," As schools made the switch to remote teaching in 2020, Andrew Bacher-Hicks, an assistant professor of education at Boston University, kept hearing an alarming prediction: Cyberbullying would spike. With students living more of their lives online, wouldn’t this pernicious form of harassment — which some researchers have found is even more closely correlated with suicidal ideation than in-person bullying — take off? (According to one 2019 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 20 percent of American high school students reported being bullied in person in the previous year; 16 percent reported being bullied online.) Bacher-Hicks and four colleagues at B.U. — associate professors Joshua Goodman, Jennifer G. Green and Melissa Holt — tackled the question using an unusual approach: They first established, by examining past data, that Google searches for such terms as “bullying” and “cyberbullying” closely track real-world trends, as measured in surveys. They then looked at what happened to search trends during the pandemic. The results, which appeared in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper in December, weren’t what many people expected. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: Online is a space where people bully one another, so some people predicted things would go off the rails when schools went remote. A: Exactly. Those predictions were based on research that was done before the pandemic. It shows when schooling is constant — when there’s not a major disruption to schooling — there’s a correlation between students who spend more time online and the amount of cyberbullying that they experience. That evidence did suggest that there was some cause for concern when nearly all K-12 students were spending a lot more time online. Q: You end up establishing that, at least in the pre-pandemic world, Google Trends data — on searches related to bullying — tracks pretty well with real-world, state-level survey answers regarding bullying behavior. Just to quickly summarize what you found: Google searches for topics related to bullying drop off markedly during the summer. They are especially high at the start of a school year, then fade a bit. Most remarkably, you’ve got biannual surveys of students by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — state-by-state data on self-reported bullying. The Google Trends data tracks variation in those survey answers — state by state and over time — which is pretty remarkable. A: Yeah. We did think, when we first saw it, that the tracking of the school calendar was pretty amazing. There’s a very clear spike in searches in the beginning of the school year, a dip over periods when school was not in session, to some degree — over the winter recess, for example. Then a large drop-off over the summer. And this pattern happens year after year after year. So there’s a clear connection between Internet searches for bullying and the school calendar. And we did connect these biennial surveys from the CDC and found a strong correlation between areas where students self-reported more bullying and searches for bullying that happened in that area. And the same thing for cyberbullying. So we were able to validate the link between Internet searches and self-reported survey information — for both those topics — in the time period before covid. Q: Some schools went all virtual. Some schools were hybrid. Some schools stayed open. You’ve got data on where those schools are. When schools went all virtual, how much did searches for school bullying and cyberbullying drop? A: The first analysis that we conducted looked at the period directly following March 2020, when schools across the entire country abruptly switched from in-person instruction to remote instruction. And during that time, we found that searches related to school bullying and cyberbullying both dropped by 30 to 35 percent. Q: You also looked at the next school year, where approaches to schooling were a little more mixed, and had similar findings, right? A: We found similar findings overall. But we had a nice opportunity in the fall of 2020 because there was a lot of variation across different types of schools. Some were quick to open back up for in-person instruction, where others remained remote. And what we saw is that bullying dropped no matter what: In both forms of instruction, school bullying and cyberbullying remained lower than in prior years. However, the drop in both forms of bullying was much larger in the areas that remained remote. Q:  If I understand it right, in your interpretation online bullying is largely an outgrowth of in-school bullying. A: Absolutely. I think that bullying that occurs online may in many cases just be an extension of bullying that started in person. We know from prior research that many of the same individuals — that is, both the victims and the aggressors — are involved in in-person and in cyberbullying. So there are clear links between the two. And I think an important contribution of our paper is to show that when you disrupt one form of bullying, there is a clear reduction in both forms. Q: Your paper suggests there might be lessons for this and for the post-pandemic world. What might those be? Because kids eventually will be all back in these chaotic physical environments again. A: The lessons might come out of this question: Why do we think that even when schools reopened in fall 2020 during the pandemic, bullying was lower in those schools than we would have predicted? One reason is that schools put additional structures in place to prevent the spread of covid-19. And many of those structures likely helped to reduce bullying when students were back in person. We know from prior studies that a lot of bullying occurs during unstructured time — that is, time spent passing other students in the hallway, time at lunch, etc. During the pandemic, there has been a lot less flexibility in offering that type of unstructured time. And there is a lot more supervision during the school day. I don’t think that we should necessarily maintain all of these new structures moving forward, but I think it does suggest there’s something that we can learn about how providing additional structured time might reduce bullying. Q: All of this really complicates the whole mental health picture for students. Because what we hear is that students are isolated. Students are depressed. All of that’s true. On the other hand, you can’t help but think that the 20 percent of students who are bullied might have found some relief during the pandemic. A: I think that’s fair. I will say, you know, nearly all of the educational research that I see to date has focused on the negative consequences that you just mentioned. This study suggests that at least some aspects of the educational experience have improved for some set of students. This does not mean that we should maintain this crazy system that we have right now, but it does suggest that there might be a small subset of students who really suffered from bullying in the past, for whom reducing in-person time could be beneficial. Q: What else should we take away from this study? A: If you look over time in that biennial survey by the CDC — at the national numbers showing how prevalent bullying is — it’s been fairly static over time. And so to see a large shift [down] in bullying, I think, is a good sign. It suggests that it’s not some static concept. It’s not something that we have to accept. It shows that changes can occur. That suggests that there is room and scope for really making a dent in what I think is a serious challenge that clearly affects a lot of students.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3BaatjG,"outlookperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
144,2022-02-10,Who could have seen another Russian doping issue coming? Everyone but the IOC.," BEIJING — We ended up here, with yet another Russian doping scandal at yet another Olympics, because Russia was never properly punished for its original sins. The Russians were so set upon success at the 2014 Winter Games, hosted at their own Black Sea resort of Sochi, that they ran a state-sponsored doping system. Olympics missed by Russian athletes since the scheme was exposed: zero. That’s not on Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old figure skater who was part of the Russian Olympic Committee team that won a gold medal here — but has yet to receive it. The International Testing Agency on Friday confirmed that Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, a medicine that can be used to treat chest pain but is on the banned list because it increases blood flow efficiency and improves endurance. Vilifying Valieva, a favorite for gold in the women’s competition, does nothing for anyone. The idea that a 15-year-old girl is trying to evade the World Anti-Doping Agency and cheat her way to multiple golds on her own is laughable. This is a systemic issue, and Valieva — even if this drug helped her in any way — is only a product of the system from which she came. About that system: Go back to July 2016, with the Rio de Janeiro Olympics at hand. By that point, there were independent documentaries and independent commissions and independent reporting that laid bare evidence that Russia had, among other things, systematically swapped out dirty urine samples for clean ones to cover up doping. The International Olympic Committee took that evidence and decided not to ban Russia from those Games. In a move that fits with what’s playing out here, the IOC merely abdicated responsibility and granted it to the 28 federations that oversee individual sports internationally. Never mind that those federations were ill-equipped to make such decisions. Put aside the ridiculous notion that dirty sports were charged with willfully cleaning themselves up. What mattered was that the IOC could kick the can down the road. It’s elite at that. That was the opportunity, right there: Ban Russian athletes for four years — a full Olympic cycle, covering one Summer and one Winter Games — and maybe we wouldn’t be here. Instead, the can has dropped here, in Beijing, all these years later. Valieva’s positive and the clamor around it stem from the fact that the IOC has scrutinized athletes and raked over individual cases but has never held the system accountable. Instead we got meaningless wardrobe cleansing, mandating that competitors wear “Olympic Athlete from Russia” on their uniforms in PyeongChang and the ROC logo since. And we got new music when a Russian wins gold, exchanging the Russian national anthem for Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1. What was needed — to serve Valieva, to serve her teammates, to serve the athletes she competes against — was sweeping change forced from the outside. The easy view is to paint Valieva’s competitors as the victims, because if a “dirty” athlete beats a “clean” one, there’s obvious injustice. Indeed, the IOC has put off the medals ceremony for the team competition, citing the controversy’s status as a “legal case.” Should the Russians be disqualified because of Valieva’s violation, the U.S. athletes could be declared gold medalists. It all has so many people here wringing their hands with righteous indignation. In an interview with the website Around the Rings, Susanne Lyons, the board chairwoman of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said her “great fear” is that doping violations are not handled evenly across countries and national Olympic committees. “Really, the whole credibility of the Olympic movement and the Paralympic movement stands teetering on the edge of us saying that we really believe and live the values that we say we stand for,” Lyons said. “And I just hope that’s what we’ll see in this specific situation that’s happening today.” Lyons’s organization, it’s worth pointing out, oversaw a system that allowed for widespread sexual assault of teenage girls over years. When it comes to preaching morality, tread lightly. This is an athletic crisis, though — a crisis of confidence. Experts in athlete advocacy contend that the aggrieved parties here aren’t just those who compete against the Russians. They’re the Russians themselves, because for too long the attitude there has been: You’re either in the system or you won’t be competing. That cries for a full-blown overhaul, not the semantic four-year ban WADA issued in 2019, a ban that the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced to two years in 2020. What difference did any of it make? Cleared Russian athletes were in Tokyo last summer and are here now. Some of those athletes, on skates, won figure skating gold Monday. The IOC has not commented — indeed, has deflected questions — about the status of those medals, not to mention the sanctity of the competition. “We don’t want to hear about the other stuff, but it arises,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a media briefing Thursday, before the ITA’s confirmation. “It’s life and so it has to be dealt with, has to be dealt with properly, has to be dealt with in a proper and transparent way, a legal way. And we will deal with it, and we will deal with it as quickly as possible. But I think it doesn’t — it shouldn’t and it doesn’t take away from the magic of the Games.” What a wonderful world in which to live, this magical place in which Adams can speak with a straight face about transparency but provide zero information about what’s going on. Whatever the outcome, whatever the timing, withhold judgment on Valieva, a teenage girl. Russian athletes are only products of the system that produces them. The IOC has let that system, um, skate. Until it demands an overhaul, why would we think the next Olympics — or the one after that or the one after that — wouldn’t be consumed by a new version of the same old story?",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3HT6IS0,"olympicsperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
145,2022-02-10,"With watchers on the ground and spy drones overhead, U.S. zeroed in on Islamic State leader’s hideout"," Last fall, a U.S. spy drone moved into position over a house on the edge of an olive grove in northwestern Syria, its camera straining for a glimpse of a bearded man who was said to live inside. The man, who was sometimes called “the professor,” had lost a leg in war and rarely left his third-floor apartment. So the drone fixed its lens on the building’s rooftop terrace and waited. Other intelligence assets with cameras and remote sensors joined the vigil, above and around the house, and eventually the effort was rewarded. On certain days, weather permitting, the man could be seen hobbling onto the terrace with a mat for his daily prayers. At other times he took along a towel and rinsed off in a rooftop shower. Occasionally he would venture outside for a short walk, or just to stand at the door for some fresh air. The man’s physical disability stood out. He was missing his right leg. It matched precisely the description of the man who was the subject of the intensive search: Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, leader of the Islamic State. With additional surveillance, U.S. intelligence analysts confirmed the identity. After a two-year manhunt, the elusive Qurayshi had been spotted, first by informants on the ground, and then that tip was confirmed by the drone’s telescopic lens. For U.S. officials involved in the search, two questions remained. One was how to kill or capture him while minimizing risk to U.S. forces and to the more than a dozen women and children who lived in the same building. The other: whether to strike quickly, or to wait and try to gather more information about Qurayshi’s far-flung network of underground terrorist cells. The waiting, which ultimately stretched over several months, proved to be worthwhile, according to current and former U.S. and Middle Eastern intelligence officials who described details of the operation that ended the career of one of the world’s most-wanted terrorists. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss highly classified material. “There was foot traffic: couriers and communication between cells,” said a former senior intelligence official briefed on the events. “They milked it, to collect as much data as they could. They had to see who he was talking to.” The death of Qurayshi was announced by President Biden last week, at the conclusion of an operation in which U.S. Delta Force commandos surrounded the militant’s safe house, which U.S. officials say was rigged with a bomb that detonated as they closed in, killing Qurayshi and his family. This account, pieced together from interviews and briefings with officials from multiple U.S. agencies and one foreign government that provided assistance, offers new insight into the methodical search that led to Qurayshi, as well as the weeks of careful surveillance of the terrorist leader, which occurred at a time when the Islamic State was seeking to rebuild its network after six years of setbacks and defeats. The picture of Qurayshi that emerged from the surveillance is that of a hands-on commander who was firmly in charge of his organization and harbored ambitions for reestablishing the self-declared Islamist caliphate that once controlled a territory the size of England. His intensive involvement in operational planning made Qurayshi especially dangerous, officials said. But over time, it also made him more vulnerable. “He was very much in command,” a senior Biden administration official said of Qurayshi, a 45-year-old Iraqi who was born Amir Mohammed al-Mawli al-Salbi. He was known informally as Haji Abdullah, or to his disciples, as Professor Abdullah or simply “the professor,” because of his academic degrees and past role as one of the Islamic State’s official interpreters of sharia, or Islamic law. His lieutenants and couriers were “very active,” the official said, in “making sure that Haji Abdullah’s commands and orders were known.” Last week’s raid was the culmination of a two-year search that began with Qurayshi’s promotion to leader of the Islamic State. His elevation to “caliph” followed the death of his predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who killed himself with a bomb during a similar raid by U.S. commandos in October 2019. Baghdadi’s dramatic end occurred just 15 miles from the three-story cinder-block house in the farming community of Atma, Syria, that became Qurayshi’s headquarters and final residence. Documents reveal that the building’s second-floor dwelling was rented last March by a man who U.S. officials think was Abu Ahmed al-Halabi, a senior Qurayshi lieutenant. The deputy moved in, and two weeks later, he obtained a lease for the top floor as well. Sometime afterward, Qurayshi took up residence in the modest third-floor apartment with a rooftop view of fields and olive trees. To evade his many pursuers, the Islamic State leader adopted rigorous security protocols, U.S. officials said. In addition to banning cellphones and Internet connections, he relied on couriers — human messengers are regarded by the Islamic State as safer than cellphones and others electronic communications. But that arrangement  ensured visits by strangers to Atma, a town on the Turkish border that’s far removed, physically and culturally, from the terrorist group’s traditional strongholds in the Euphrates Valley. Many locals view the Islamic State with fear and disdain, and some, officials say, eventually cast a suspicious eye on the mysterious newcomer and his visitors. The officials said Qurayshi — distinctive because of the leg, which CIA analysts think was amputated after injuries suffered in a 2015 airstrike — was sometimes spotted outside the house, or when taking brief strolls through the olive trees. Word eventually made its way to informants who work for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a mainly Kurdish militia group closely allied to the United States, current and former U.S. officials said. Intensive surveillance began immediately afterward, with Kurdish watchers following the arrivals and departures of armed men who trudged upstairs to meet with Qurayshi. The surveillance was expanded to include some of the U.S. government’s most sophisticated remote cameras and sensors, most of them on drones operated by the Defense Department, the officials said. Over the following weeks, CIA “targeters” — analysts who sift through raw intelligence to piece together leads about terrorism suspects — devoted hundreds of work hours to the case, adding to efforts by other intelligence and defense analysts who kept watch over the house and neighborhood. “We worked extensively with the intelligence community to develop a deep understanding of the people located at the building, and the pattern of life of all the occupants that were there,” a senior military official said at a briefing on Thursday. The effort eventually not only confirmed Qurayshi’s identity, officials said, but also touched off an agonizing debate over tactics: whether to launch a “standoff” airstrike that risked killing innocents, or to send U.S. commandos into a turbulent region of Syria controlled by a patchwork of armed groups that includes militants linked to al-Qaeda. By late September. U.S. Special Forces teams had begun training for a raid on the house, which military planners thought was almost certain to feature booby traps designed to stop assailants. Those preparations entailed regular rehearsals with models, including a full-scale mock-up of the dwelling, two senior military officials closely involved with the operation said. An airstrike against the house was considered but quickly ruled out, senior military officials said. “There were too many noncombatants,” including a family with children living on the first floor, a military official said. The alternative, a long-range helicopter raid using commandos, was a “more risky proposition to U.S. forces,” the official added, “but the goal of the mission was to capture the leader of ISIS, gather what intelligence we could, and of course avoid any unnecessary civilian harm.” On Dec. 20, the president met with his national security team to formally approve the operation against Qurayshi, officials said. The president asked about civilian casualties and whether the house might collapse if the terrorist leader detonated a bomb, potentially killing the families below. Military engineers studied the structure and concluded that it would not. There appeared to be no cause for urgency in carrying out the raid, several officials said. In addition to the need for planning and training, there were practical considerations, such as weather and the lunar phase, a moonless night being the preferred choice for commando operations. In the meantime, constant monitoring allowed intelligence officials to expand their knowledge of Qurayshi’s underground network, which included dozens of cells scattered across Syria and Iraq. Because of the intensity of the surveillance, U.S. officials were confident that they could “detect any attempt to leave” the house, the former senior intelligence official said. Such an attempt would in any case provide an opportunity for an airstrike away from the structure and its civilian occupants. The intervening weeks produced a trove of intelligence, the official said, as couriers were tracked and subsequently monitored as they met with contacts in other parts of Iraq and Syria. The flow of messengers to the house in Atma increased further after last month’s massive assault by Islamic State militants on a prison in al-Hasakah, in Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria. U.S. officials said Qurayshi was heavily involved in planning for the attack on the prison. “This guy was working it,” the former senior intelligence official said of Qurayshi, who oversaw the group as it carried out a steady stream of assassinations and bombings across Syria and Iraq. “You saw a guy with blood on his hands.” By Feb. 1, military planners decided that conditions for a commando raid were nearly perfect. At an Oval Office meeting Biden was briefed on the final plans, and gave his approval. The next day — Feb. 2, at 5 p.m. Washington time, the president was called into the White House Situation Room to monitor the raid through a video connection to the Pentagon. “It was very quiet and very tense,” a senior administration official said, recalling the mood in the room. “There was not a lot of talking.” Contributing to the stress, officials said, was the knowledge that U.S. forces would be operating in hostile territory dominated by extremist groups. The commandos also were traveling into and out of airspace controlled by the Russian military. A decision was made to refrain from alerting Moscow ahead of time, and to rely instead on a deconfliction channel to defuse any problems. By 1 a.m. local time on Feb. 3 — 6 p.m. Feb. 2 in Washington — helicopters carrying two dozen members of the elite force were hovering over the house in Atma. As the Delta team prepared to descend on ropes, Apache helicopter gunships, fighter jets and armed Reaper drones prowled the skies to watch for trouble. The thrum of helicopter rotors woke neighbors, and people spilled out of their houses to see what was happening. Some described hearing a voice shouting Arabic commands over a loudspeaker. “Whoever wants to preserve his soul, come out,” the voice said. Men in body armor emerged from one of the helicopters and scurried down ropes onto the ground below. Using a bullhorn to announce themselves, they rounded up the family on the first floor — a man, a woman and several children — and led them away. Qurayshi would neither surrender nor allow his family to escape. According to official accounts, buttressed by witnesses and analysts who reviewed photographs of the building’s interior, Qurayshi or his associates had rigged the dwelling with explosives to ensure that he could not be taken alive. It remains unclear who detonated the bomb. Military officials said they think it’s likely he did, but that they haven’t ruled out the possibility it was someone else — perhaps one of his wives. The blast was later judged to be far more powerful that the suicide vest that Baghdadi used to kill himself three years earlier. The family on the ground floor had just left when an explosion lit up the sky, with a boom that could be heard miles away. The force of the blast blew out several walls and hurled bodies and body parts onto the ground, three floors below. A pause followed. Wary about the possibility of additional booby traps, the Delta team sent “other capabilities” — presumably a robot probe or small drone — to scan the remains of the apartment, military officials said. As they searched, the commandos came under fire by Qurayshi’s lieutenant on the second floor, and then by the lieutenant’s wife. Both of them were killed in an exchange of gunfire, and several children on the floor were removed by American troops and turned over to another family nearby, officials said. Two hours after the start of the mission, it was over. As some members of the Delta team scooped up papers and other potentially valuable intelligence from inside the house, others took fingerprints from Qurayshi’s remains and bagged a biological sample for DNA testing. The body was left there, amid the rubble of the house on the edge of the olive grove. Just before 7 a.m. Washington time — roughly 12 hours after the raid ended, the tests were completed, and the identity of the Islamic State leader was confirmed. White House officials prepared a formal announcement, which Biden would deliver on live television. “This horrible terrorist leader is no more,” Biden said.

146,2022-02-11,A U.S.-born Muslim has a question for racists: Go back to where?," About US is a forum to explore issues of race and identity in the United States. Sign up for the newsletter. This essay was adapted from Wajahat Ali’s new book, “Go Back to Where You Came From: And Other Helpful Recommendations on How to Become American,” which published in January. Some people cry, some rage and some laugh when they are always asked to be welcoming but are still never welcomed to the American barbecue. Each emotional response is valid in processing and dealing with the daily pain of knowing your own country doesn’t want you. I try to find some dark humor embedded with the perpetual discomfort and absurdity. Humor, both sublime and silly, sophomoric and sophisticated, unleashed with purpose, can often help communicate very real, hard truths about American society. My name is Wajahat Ali. I am what diversity and outreach coordinators refer to as a “Muslim man of color.” I am neither White nor Black. Instead, I belong to a growing, miscellaneous tribe known as “people of color.” Recently, I’ve been informed that I’ve been inducted into something called BIPOC. It’s an acronym for Black, Indigenous and People of Color. It also sounds like a malevolent cybernetic entity from a dystopian science fiction novel or an advanced breathing apparatus for people suffering from sleep apnea. I apparently belong to the POC part of BIPOC. I have also been affiliated with “Other” and “Asian” during high school. I briefly flirted with “Pacific Islander” in college, but who doesn’t experiment in their youth? I was born and raised in the Bay Area of California, in the year of “The Empire Strikes Back,” or 1980. I was also blessed with a trisyllabic name. Today, people at least tell me my name is unique and memorable, even as they insist on pronouncing it incorrectly. I learned early on that I always had to explain, educate and at times defend my very being. I often became the token Pakistani and Muslim friend for many of my peers who had never met someone who fasted during Ramadan and didn’t eat pork. Once, I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and took off all the pepperoni except a small piece embedded in the side of the cheese. It was delicious, but for the rest of the week I felt like a cursed character in a Poe short story, wracked by guilt, convinced Allah would punish me. My friends were curious as to whether I’d go to hell if I ever ate pork. I assured my friends that the earth would not swallow me up whole if they poured bacon bits on my salad during lunch. (They did it anyway. I did not go to hell. Well, I haven’t … yet.) I was always the odd duck. I went to an all-boys Jesuit Catholic high school in the Bay Area, where I dominated the yearly religious studies classes to the point that Father Allender almost wept when reading out the highest grades in the class: Wajahat Ali, the Muslim, followed by Kalyan, the Hindu. I carpooled with Brian, a Jew; Gaurav, a Hindu; and Allen, a Christian son of Nigerian immigrants. My America was a United Colors of Benetton ad. In the ’80s and ’90s, my parents used “Amreekans” synonymously with White people. It’s almost as if they knew, without consciously realizing, that they still weren’t part of the tribe. “Amreekans say, ‘I love you’ all the time. After waking up, going to the bathroom, going to school, on the phone. What is this nonsense?” my mother asked. My parents are not “I love you” people. To this day, I’ve never said it to them or heard them say it to me. My parents weren’t spartan or miserly with their love; I always felt it, but they just have their own way of showing it. My father still slobbers me with big wet kisses on the cheek and my mother smothers me with hugs. They do this in public, alongside giving me unsolicited, critical comments about my wardrobe, fluctuating weight and thinning hair. They always thought “I love you” was superfluous nonsense goras did that cheapened the sentiment. Gora is what we use for White people. (“Ghora” is the word for horse, so be careful.) Goras also celebrated Thanksgiving and Christmas. We didn’t. Christmas was easy because it was a Christian holiday and my mother told me point-blank at the age of 4 that Santa Claus was not going to give me presents because he didn’t exist and was simply created by goras to sell toys. She then told me I should be grateful for all the toys I already had. That same year, she decided to become the serial killer of all imaginary creatures. I was informed that the tooth fairy and the Easter Bunny also weren’t real, and that they would not be bringing me quarters or chocolate. My parents appreciated Thanksgiving and the entire tradition and concept of showing gratitude. However, they did not indulge in the customary dinner because they refused to cook this “strange,” “tasteless,” “dry bird” that goras inexplicably loved. By the early 21st century, however, they were hosting their own Thanksgiving parties, deep-frying the dry bird, respecting it with a proper masala base, and also adding achaar and chicken korma on the side. Eventually, they too became Amreekan. I always knew I was Amreekan and also a Brown-skinned kid with a strange name. I was awkward and creative. But that same dorky, shy kid who couldn’t speak English ended up graduating with an English degree from UC Berkeley and practicing law, and eventually grew up to write “so well” for the New York Times and speak “so well” on CNN. I also married way up. My wife, Sarah, is way smarter, kinder and better-looking than me. I know this because my parents remind me. “Beta, you know she’s better than you, right? Don’t mess this up,” my father warns me once a week. Remember, I am an only child, so this makes the advice that much more coldblooded. She’s also a doctor, a former athlete and a former cheerleader, and somehow she has still retained her abs despite birthing three children. If you are the person who gains weight simply by looking at food, then you are my brother or sister in this cruel journey called “Life Without Metabolism” and share my frustration at the unfairness of it all. I still fast during Ramadan, try to watch every Warriors game and do an awesome Yoda impression for my kids. I have learned how to make my mom’s excellent Pakistani and Hyderabadi dishes during quarantine. I’m about as American as chicken korma, apple pie and chai, but even after 40 years I’m still told to “go back.” Where, exactly? In America, who (and what) are you when you’re both “us” and “them”? When I’m a native but seen as a foreigner? When I’m a citizen but also seen as a perpetual suspect? When I’m your neighbor but also seen as an invader? When I’m a cultural creator but also seen as an eraser of White identity and European civilization? According to mainstream code, I will never be “ordinary” or “a real American” from the “Rust Belt” (unless you consider California the heartland, which, let’s face it, no one does). My parents are seen by some as potential terrorists because they’re from Pakistan, even though they’ve lived in this country for over 40 years. Can I be a “real” American, when I’m not White no matter how much Fair & Lovely cream I slather on my skin? The answer in 2022 is “Yes, but with conditions.” But I don’t want conditional love. I want more from America and my fellow Americans. I am not content being the token, the diversity hire, the moderate Muslim, the magical minority or “that one Brown guy” who gets the invite to the prestigious festival or space on the cover of the brochure so the company and university can show the world they are open-minded and tolerant. With the resurgence of radicalized white power movements, many are now forced to confront the reality called white supremacy that the rest of us have had to deal with our entire lives. For many, resisting meant protesting. For the rest of us, our resistance is simply walking out of our house and breathing, just holding our head up, smiling, having hope and telling our children that America belongs to them. For us, surviving is an act of resistance. There are forces that have always attempted, and ultimately failed, to make America static and rigid. But America has proved to be elastic. Our ancestors have always had to push and stretch America to accommodate its many residents and communities. We now have to do our part. If any of you have been active students of U.S. history, you know that with every two steps we march forward toward progress, we always get pushed one step back. The racially anxious men and women with hoods, tiki torches and business suits will do everything in their power to put America in a violent chokehold and drag it back to 1953. This is the year before the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. I’m convinced that 1953 is also the year that many enemies of diversity and progress believe America was allegedly “great.” You might disagree with me, sometimes passionately, about my opinions, choices and what the appropriate path is for America to move forward toward becoming “great again.” But boring an audience is a grave sin. I believe God said in one of the Holy Books, “Verily, thou shan’t boreth an audience or thy Lord shall smite thee and make ye eat stale naan.” Bismillah.* * In Arabic, “Bismillah” means “In the name of God.” People generally use it to invoke a beginning. If you’ve already said it, you’ve become a Muslim.

147,2022-02-11,Biden proposes splitting billions in Afghanistan funds between 9/11 victims and humanitarian aid," President Biden began clearing a pathway Friday for releasing about $3.5 billion in frozen Afghan reserve funds held in the United States to be used for humanitarian and other assistance in Afghanistan, while an equal amount would be reserved for families of 9/11 victims who have legal claims against the Taliban. The plan, including an executive order that Biden signed Friday, is an attempt to grapple with some of the financial implications of Biden’s decision to end the U.S. war in Afghanistan after 20 years of conflict. When the Taliban toppled the Afghan government last August, it left uncertainty concerning $7 billion in Afghan central bank funds remaining in the United States. The Biden administration froze the Afghan assets in August. The president’s order, invoking constitutional and statutory emergency powers, blocks and transfers all of the money, from any U.S. financial institution, to a consolidated account at the New York Federal Reserve, where most of it is already held, until domestic litigation surrounding it has been resolved. Additional Afghan central bank funds totaling more than $2 billion are frozen in other countries. The United Nations has estimated that the vast majority of Afghanistan’s 40 million people will suffer severe hunger this winter and that many, especially children, will die. The administration has been under pressure from humanitarian organizations and some lawmakers to release the funds. The Taliban, with some support from Russia, China and other countries, has demanded that all the money be released. The Taliban quickly rejected the U.S. plan. Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban’s designated U.N. representative, told The Washington Post that “the frozen funds are the reserves of the Afghan central bank. This should be totally unfrozen and transferred to [the] Afghan bank as reserves. We don’t want what the [United States] is planning.” Abdullah Azzam, secretary to Taliban acting first deputy prime minister Abdul Ghani Baradar, said on Twitter that “Biden doesn’t have the right to pay from Afghans’ assets the ransoms of those whom the Afghans have not killed. American President should not prove his generosity by paying from others’ wealth.” The Afghan reserves were frozen, along with foreign aid that had provided up to 75 percent of Afghanistan’s budget, when the Taliban ousted the U.S.-backed government. No country has recognized the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate government. The sudden cutoff of funds has closed the country’s banking system and brought the economy near to collapse. Emergency aid money has been funneled through the United Nations and international agencies, including more than $500 million from the United States since August, to provide food, shelter and health care, along with direct payment of some salaries to government employees such as health-care workers. The United Nations has set up a program to distribute those donations without releasing them into the hands of the Taliban, whose organization and many of its leaders are under sanctions. The administration pressed for a U.N. Security Council resolution in December to exempt a broad range of humanitarian activities from sanctions, and issued its own Treasury Department waivers. More than $200 million was released from a frozen World Bank trust fund, set up years ago for Afghanistan, with restrictions to avoid access by the Taliban. But the United States and its international allies and partners have said the militants should not have any of the money until they comply with demands to form a more inclusive government, guarantee human and civil rights for minorities and women, allow girls to attend school at all levels, break all ties with terrorist groups and ensure that there are no reprisals against those associated with the former government or its backers. “We expect ultimately the resources will be deployed for benefit of the Afghan people, while ensuring they will not be a direct benefit to the Taliban,” said one of two senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the initiative. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration. Biden’s executive order stipulates that a “widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan — including the urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, shelter and settlement assistance, and Covid-19-related assistance, among other basic human needs — and the potential for a deepening economic collapse” pose a national security and foreign policy threat to the United States. “I also understand that various parties, including representatives of victims of terrorism, have asserted legal claims” against the funds, the order says. The officials emphasized that the order was only a first step to distributing the money. Relatives of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and other terrorist acts won a judgment against the Taliban — which was providing a haven for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden at the time of the attacks — attaching the funds. But the case has been on hold as the administration determined its position. In a 28-page “statement of interest” filed late Friday in a federal court, the Justice Department said — concurrent with Biden’s order and declaration of a national security interest — that the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control had on Friday issued a license authorizing the transfer of $3.5 billion in the Afghan assets into a separate blocked account, and then to an unnamed person or group of people it designates as authorized to receive the money “for the benefit of the people of Afghanistan.” In asking a federal judge to approve this arrangement, the administration argued that the president was fully within his constitutional and statutory authority, and that funds under OFAC license are not subject to the 2002 law authorizing compensation for victims of terrorist acts. Although it raised questions about the legal rights of the victim litigants to the remaining $3.5 billion, the statement said they should have “a full opportunity” to argue their case in court. In terms of the “immediate crisis” in Afghanistan, an official said, “because we have to go through a judicial process here, there is going to be at least a couple of months before we can move any of this money. So it’s not going to be available regardless.” The proposal will probably draw sharp criticism from some U.S. lawmakers who oppose making any assistance available to Afghanistan that could — even indirectly — benefit the Taliban. In anticipation of a court decision, a range of groups representing 9/11 victims and their families have variously argued that all, some or none of the money should go to Afghanistan. If approved, disbursal of the $3.5 billion for Afghanistan would be strictly monitored, and “we are going to be ensuring that there are very robust controls in place,” the official said. “It is not going to the Taliban; it is going to be used for the benefit of the Afghan people.    Asked about Afghan assets frozen in other countries, which in some cases have been urged by the United States not to release them, the second official said that “we fully anticipate there will be significant multilateral components to a mechanism that is built to determine the disposition of these funds.” Susannah George in Islamabad, Pakistan, and Matt Viser in Washington contributed to this report. An earlier version of this article referred to Abdul Ghani Baradar as Taliban deputy foreign minister. He is acting first deputy prime minister for economic affairs.

148,2022-02-11,"Biden, Putin to speak Saturday as U.S. warns that imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine is ‘distinct possibility’"," There is a “very distinct possibility” that Russia will invade Ukraine in a “reasonably swift time frame,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Friday, urging all Americans in Ukraine to “leave as soon as possible, and in any event within the next 24 to 48 hours.” “If you stay, you are assuming risk with no guarantee that there will be any other opportunity to leave, and no prospect of a U.S. military evacuation in the event of a Russian invasion,” Sullivan said in the White House briefing room. An attack, he said, would be “likely to begin” with aerial bombing and missile strikes, and “no one would be able to count on air or rail or road departures.” As U.S. warnings sharply escalated, the White House said President Biden would speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin late Saturday morning, Washington time. The Kremlin said Biden had requested the call. U.S. officials said the Russians proposed it take place Monday but accepted Biden’s Saturday counterproposal. The announcement of the call came amid reports of new intelligence — and evidence on the ground — over the past several days indicating that Russia, with 130,000 troops and major weaponry surrounding Ukraine on three sides, is now fully prepared to launch an invasion. Sullivan said the United States has no confirmation that Putin has made the final decision to attack. But, he said, “we believe he very well may give the final go order. That is a very distinct possibility.” “It may well happen,” he said. “It may well happen soon.” As diplomatic efforts to resolve the Ukraine crisis remained at a stalemate, Russia kicked off a second day of major military exercises near Ukraine’s borders in Belarus that analysts say could presage an invasion. Biden held a call early Friday with his counterparts in Canada, Britain and other NATO nations to further coordinate “diplomacy and deterrence,” the White House said. As the mood also darkened in Europe, ambassadors from NATO member countries convened in Brussels to discuss the continued Russian buildup, a U.S. official said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a visit to Australia that the West continues to see “troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border.” “As we’ve said before, we’re in a window when an invasion could begin at any time, and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics,” Blinken said. He referred to speculation among some officials that Putin may wait for the conclusion of the Winter Games in Beijing to avoid angering China, its key partner. The military exercises in Belarus are scheduled to end on Feb. 20, the day the Olympics conclude. According to one Western official, Moscow’s military preparations for a full-scale invasion are complete. “Militarily it can start within days,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. “It’s up to Putin.” The U.S. judgment that Putin is likely to launch an attack, potentially as early as next week, is based in part on new intelligence that Russia is planning to conduct a false-flag operation to create a pretext for invading Ukraine, according to multiple officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss administration deliberations. The precise date and nature of the alleged Russian operation was unclear. U.S. officials had earlier accused Russia of planning to stage and film a fake attack by Ukrainian military forces on Russia as a pretext for invasion. On Thursday evening, a meeting in the White House Situation Room was quickly convened to discuss the latest developments. Sullivan declined to discuss specific intelligence assessments, but he said that “the intelligence community has sufficient confidence that I can stand before you today and say … there is a distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin would order a military action, an invasion of Ukraine, in this window,” potentially including “the time period before February 20th.” The intelligence community, he added, believes that “everything I have just said is well-grounded, in both what they are seeing on the ground and what they are picking up through all of their various sources.” Reminded of faulty intelligence that preceded the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Sullivan said there was a “fundamental distinction” between the two situations. “In Iraq, intelligence was used and deployed … to start a war,” he said. “We are trying to stop a war.” “All we can do is come here before you in good faith and share everything that we know … while protecting [intelligence] sources and methods,” Sullivan said. “Today, we are talking about more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed along the Ukrainian border,” he said, noting that photos of the deployments were “all over social media.” A senior European diplomat confirmed that the United States had shared intelligence leading to a new sense of urgency and noted that a number of countries are now telling their citizens to evacuate immediately. Britain’s Foreign Office issued an advisory that “British nationals in Ukraine should leave now while commercial means are still available.” Denmark and Norway issued similar advice. Sullivan urged the thousands of U.S. citizens believed to be in Ukraine to leave immediately, saying, “The risk is now high enough and the threat is now immediate enough that this is what prudence demands.” He said that, unlike in Afghanistan, there would be no U.S. military evacuation. “The president will not be putting the lives of our men and women in uniform at risk by sending them into a war zone to rescue people who could have left now but chose not to,” he said. “So we are asking people to make the responsible choice.” U.S. officials confirmed Friday that an additional 3,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division would be sent to Poland, adding to the 1,700 troops already dispatched to that country. The new deployment was first reported by Reuters. Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke Friday by telephone with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov. The two “discussed several security-related issues of concern” but as with previous calls between them “agreed to keep the specific details of their conversation private,” a Milley spokesperson said. Milley also spoke with counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom, as well as the head of the NATO military committee on “adjustment of the U.S. force posture in Europe.” Sullivan emphasized that U.S. troops are not “being sent to go fight Russia in Ukraine. They are not going to war in Ukraine. They are not going to war with Russia.” U.S. forces, he said, are in place in NATO countries to reinforce and defend the alliance within its own territory. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. To defend it, the United States and other allies have sent hundreds of millions of dollars of defensive military equipment and trained its armed forces. The allies have promised swift and severe economic sanctions, designed to cripple a significant portion of the Russian economy and industry, if Moscow launches military action against Ukraine. They have offered to discuss and address Russia’s security concerns about NATO expansion in Eastern Europe but not to meet Putin’s principal demand that the alliance promise never to admit Ukraine. In Ukraine, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba invoked diplomatic agreements to ask Russia for detailed information about its exercises, including precise locations, numbers of troops and dates of completed activity. Russia has 48 hours to comply, Kuleba said. Noncompliance could escalate to emergency meetings within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, experts said. After a meeting Friday in Moscow with his British counterpart, Ben Wallace, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said, “Unfortunately, the level of our cooperation is close to zero and about to cross the zero meridian and go into negative, which is undesirable,” according to an Agence France-Presse report that cited Russian news agencies. Shoigu blasted Ukraine’s partners for “gorging” the country with weapons, a reference to the United States supplying antitank weapons and to other NATO allies, such as Lithuania, sending antiaircraft missile launchers. “It is coming from all sides, and it is done publicly. It is done demonstrably. Not entirely clear why,” Shoigu said as Russian drills on Ukraine’s northern, eastern and southern flanks ramped up. Russia denies having plans to attack Ukraine from Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Exercises that began Thursday in Belarus, within striking distance of Ukrainian territory, are the largest Russia has ever held in the neighboring country. The operations involve tens of thousands of troops and sophisticated weapons systems such as S-400 surface-to-air missiles, Pantsir air defense systems and Su-35 fighter jets. On the second day of the maneuvers, the Russian military touted field training on land and in the air. Fighter jet crews practiced destroying approaching aircraft, and Russian motorized rifle units paired with Belarusian special operations forces to attack mock troop formations. Marine scouts also led classes on ambush tactics and surveillance, the Russian Defense Ministry said. The Kremlin is also conducting military maneuvers in the Black Sea, near Ukraine’s southern coastline. This week, a detachment of six Russian landing ships arrived at the Sevastopol port in Crimea. The ships typically are used for unloading troops, vehicles and equipment. Some were used in Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008. Horton reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. Cheng reported from Seoul.

149,2022-02-11,Biden says easing mask mandates ‘probably premature’ as blue states loosen covid restrictions," President Biden said Thursday that easing indoor masking requirements was “probably premature,” as an increasing number of states announce plans to roll back such restrictions amid a sharp decline in covid-linked hospitalizations. But Biden refrained from criticizing the governors of those states, saying it was tough to judge if they were moving too quickly. “It’s hard to say whether they are wrong,” he told Lester Holt on NBC “Nightly News. “They set a time limit and I assume it has something to do with whether the omicron variant continues to dive,” Biden added. The remarks come as several states, many of them led by Democratic governors, lay out plans to loosen mandates despite warnings from federal health officials. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rochelle Walensky, said this week that “now is not the moment” to drop masking mandates. On Thursday, Nevada became the latest state to remove a requirement that people wear face masks in most indoor settings. Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) said the mandate would be lifted immediately in some instances, though they would remain for areas such as health-care facilities. Nevada joins Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, California, New York, Illinois and Massachusetts on the list of states to say they will loosen restrictions. All but Massachusetts are led by Democratic governors. Federal regulators continue to endorse universal indoor masking in many situations. But Biden said he realized the omicron-driven surge has had a “profound impact on the psyche of the American people,” in an apparent reference to the public fatigue from a global pandemic that is now in its third year. The number of new daily infections has dropped significantly in the United States, official figures show. The seven-day average of new infections peaked on Jan. 15, hovering above 806,000, according to CDC data. As of Wednesday, it was just over 215,000. Hospital admissions linked to covid, measured on a seven-day moving average, also peaked on Jan. 15, at around 21,600. That had fallen to about 12,100 as of Tuesday. Those numbers are still elevated compared with earlier points during the pandemic, though vaccination rates are also higher. Federal officials have previously noted that many of the Democratic governors that loosened mask mandates do not prevent local jurisdictions from imposing them. “We’ve always said that these decisions are going to have to be made at the local level and that policies at the local level will look at local cases,” CDC director Walensky told reporters Wednesday. “They’ll look at how local hospitals are doing, they’ll look at local vaccination rates.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/34RlcmP,national
150,2022-02-11,"Biden’s presidential transition was ‘particularly arduous.’ Trump was to blame, but a revamped process could help."," When Congress was considering the 2015 presidential transition law, former senator Ted Kaufman, for whom it was named, said the transfer of power “presents us with a moment of potential vulnerability.” That was years before anyone knew how vulnerable that transfer would become under a president who could not admit he was a loser. The 2020-2021 transition from Donald Trump to Joe Biden was “particularly arduous,” according to a new report, largely because of “the outgoing president’s unwillingness to accept the election results.” A number of changes to the process could help in the future, both for normal transitions and in case America elects another norms-defying president, according to the study from the good government group Partnership for Public Service and the Boston Consulting Group. “Trump’s refusal to concede the election led to a delay in ascertainment — the formal decision that initiates the government’s post-election financial and substantive support for the winning candidate,” the report says. “In addition to delaying funding and access to federal agencies, some members of the Trump administration were not fully cooperative with the incoming Biden team, further complicating matters.” The delay by Emily Murphy, then Trump’s appointed General Services Administration (GSA) boss, resulted in an abbreviated post-election transition period that started almost three weeks late. Instead of beginning immediately after Election Day as usual and lasting about 78 days, the transition was cut to 57 days, according to the study. That exacerbated an already complex process. Making presidential transitions, and the services and facilities available to the president-elect’s team, more independent of the previously nonpolitical, perfunctory, election confirmation process was one report recommendation that could facilitate a smooth transfer of power even with a recalcitrant sitting president. “Federal agencies and the White House should share information equitably with still-viable candidates soon after the election irrespective of ascertainment,” meaning before a winner is formally declared, the report suggested. Securing the services and facilities are critical to the incoming president and vice president. GSA’s extensive list of those items includes “suitable office space appropriately equipped with furniture, furnishings, office and IT equipment, office supplies, parking, fleet vehicles” and payments for office staffs, consultants, travel, printing, postage and other expenses. Murphy’s delay interfered with this, and with the ability of President Biden and Vice President Harris to organize their new administration, despite their transition planning that began the April before their November victory. “Clearly it made everything much more difficult,” Kaufman, co-chair of the Biden-Harris transition team, said in an interview. The Delaware Democrat was appointed to the Senate for the remainder of Biden’s term when he resigned to become vice president in 2009. While the delay was a headache for everyone on democracy’s side, it must have been particularly painful for Kaufman, who wrote the Presidential Transitions Improvements Act that became law five years before Biden’s election. That law directs the “president to plan and coordinate activities to facilitate an efficient transfer of power to a successor President,” according to a congressional summary, and calls for a federal transition coordinator and coordinators in each executive agency. Trump had no interest in facilitating an efficient transfer of power to Biden. The transition process in the agencies, however, began months before Election Day. “Prior to the election, the White House met all deadlines required by the [1963] Presidential Transition Act thanks in large part to the leadership of deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell and a small staff,” according to the report. But when Trump’s defeat was evident and he “figured out what was going on, they just put the kibosh on it,” Kaufman recalled. “It was clear the thing just stopped … the whole process came to a halt.” That was evident in a few instances where “members of the Trump team were outright hostile” to the transition, the report said, citing former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director Russell Vought and Pentagon officials. Vought did not respond to a request for comment. Liddell, whose transition work the report acknowledged, declined questions. Christopher Miller, acting defense secretary during the transition, rejected the criticism by email. “The civil servants and political appointees at the DoD bent over backward — like they always do — to guarantee a seamless transition between administrations,” he wrote. “We faced obstacles, politicization and remarkable hostility from the Biden Administration’s Pentagon transition team leadership while providing the most fulsome support and access in modern history.” OMB was a special case because of its government-wide influence. “Contrary to past practice, the Trump White House did not believe it had an obligation to help the incoming Biden team on budget issues during the transition,” according to the report. Quoting a Roll Call article, the study said Vought refused to work with Biden’s team on budget issues, because that “is not an OMB transition responsibility.” The report said: “OMB’s sparse provision of resources and lack of analytical support did more than just inhibit the Biden team’s development of a budget. It also hindered government-wide planning for regulations and rulemaking. As Martha Coven, the OMB agency review team lead, explained, ‘OMB is so crucial to everything that government does that blocking our team there effectively blocked our team elsewhere too.’ ” OMB would be considered a “service provider to transition teams” under the report’s recommendations because of its key “core of government” responsibilities. But what can be done if future presidents, like Trump, do not accept their transition responsibilities? “There’s nothing we can do,” former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, chair of Trump’s 2016 transition team, said during a webinar on the report. “I don’t think from a congressional perspective or any other way … if the president of the United States orders his people not to do certain things, those people then have two choices, either follow the president’s order or quit. But neither one of those things will help make the transition better … “Whoever is the president is the single most important figure in a presidential transition. …” Christie added. “If presidents want to act in bad faith, then it doesn’t matter what laws are on a piece of paper.” ",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/35WnHVy,"politicsperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
151,2022-02-11,"Booster effectiveness wanes after 4 months, but showed sturdy protection against hospitalization, CDC study shows"," Booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines lose substantial effectiveness after about four months — but still provided significant protection in keeping people out of the hospital during the omicron surge, according to a study published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers found the  booster shots remained highly effective against moderate and severe covid-19  for about two months after a third dose. But their effectiveness declined substantially after four months, suggesting the need for additional boosters, the study said. The vaccine was 91 percent effective in preventing a vaccinated person from being hospitalized during the two months after a booster shot, the study found. But after four months, protection fell to 78 percent. Protection faded more in preventing trips to urgent care and emergency departments, falling from 87 percent in the first two months to 66 percent after four months. After more than five months, vaccine effectiveness fell to roughly 31 percent, but researchers noted that estimate was “imprecise because few data were available” for that group of people. Protection from the two-dose vaccine regimen has declined since omicron became dominant, but a third dose revs the immune system back up to robust levels to prevent moderately severe and severe disease, an earlier CDC study found. But how long that third shot’s protection lasts is a critical question facing public health officials because many people received their third dose months ago. Waning immunity after a third shot of mRNA vaccine during omicron has been observed in Israel and in preliminary reports from CDC, the study said. But Friday’s report represents the first real-world data in the United States of  the durability of that protection during delta and omicron. During a White House covid-19 briefing Wednesday, Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser on the pandemic response, said officials will base booster decisions on real-world “efficacy in preventing, for example, hospital visits, as well as hospitalizations.” “I think you should be appreciative of the fact that when you’re talking about any decisions that will be made — and I’m not anticipating any of that now — but that has to be put into the context of whom you’re talking about,” he said. “There may be the need for yet again another boost — in this case, a fourth-dose boost for an individual receiving the mRNA — that could be based on age, as well as underlying conditions,” Fauci said. Waning protection after a third vaccine dose “reinforces the importance of further consideration of additional doses to sustain or improve protection against COVID-19-associated” visits to emergency departments and urgent care and hospitalizations, the study said. In a statement, CDC said boosters are “safe and effective” and the study shows that a third dose of mRNA vaccine “continues to offer high levels of protection against severe disease, even months after administration, underscoring the importance of staying up to date when eligible after receiving a primary series.”  Since September, federal health officials have urged people to get the third shots. CDC recommends booster shots for everyone 12 years and older, five months after getting two doses of the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, or two months after a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. About 91 million  Americans have received boosters. Nearly 8 million had gotten their boosters at least four months ago, according to CDC data. Most of the people eligible for boosters have not received them, according to CDC calculations. That includes more than one-third of the most vulnerable people age 65 and older who have received a full dose of regular vaccines but  have not received a booster. Vermont, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Maine have vaccinated the largest share of people who had already been vaccinated. The lowest rates for booster doses are in Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi and the District. The CDC study looked at hospitalizations and emergency room and urgent care center visits in 10 states, from August to Jan. 22, 2022, covering periods when delta and omicron were dominant. In the study, about 10 percent of people were boosted and over 50 percent of people hospitalized were over 65 years old. But the report did not evaluate the variations in waning immunity by age, underlying health conditions, or a person’s immunocompromised status. Experts said the findings were not unexpected since studies have already shown vaccine effectiveness declines after two doses. While the data suggest that additional boosters may be needed, the findings underscore the added value of a booster compared with two doses. They also show that vaccines developed against the ancestral virus strains are still providing protection against new variants, said Albert Ko, an infectious-diseases physician and epidemiologist at Yale’s School of Public Health. “Each time we are boosting with these vaccines, our immune responses may be getting broader and not narrower in protecting against the scope of variants we are encountering,” he said. Protection against the array of variants two years into the pandemic is “pretty amazing, whether you’re getting the primary series or that boost.” Even after four months, the 78 percent effectiveness in preventing hospitalizations is “a silver lining,” Ko said. “It’s another argument that getting boosted now will prepare you better when you need to get boosted again in the face of new variants.” While a booster’s protection declines more over time in preventing visits to urgent care or emergency departments, Jeanne Marrazzo, an infectious-diseases physician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, also noted the robust protection against hospitalization, even after four months. The study does not provide the level of detail to know whether people were going to urgent care clinics for “a little sniffle,” she said. “That’s not the same thing as coming into the ICU and needing to be intubated.” “I honestly think we were unrealistic early on in conveying the idea that vaccine efficacy should be primarily characterized by protecting from infection,” Marrazzo wrote in an email. “As variants evolve and get better at infecting us, what we’ll need to focus on is mitigating the consequences.” In a second study released Friday, CDC reviewed data from two of its vaccine safety monitoring systems. It found that those 18 and older who received the same mRNA vaccine for all their shots had fewer side effects after the booster than after their second dose. In one safety database known as VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), which contains information on unverified reports that can be submitted by anyone, 92 percent of the reports were not considered serious, with headache, fever and muscle pain among the most commonly reported reactions. In a second safety system known as v-safe, which allows individuals to get personalized and confidential health check-ins via text messages and Web surveys, people rarely received medical care after booster, the study found.

152,2022-02-11,"Carolyn Hax: He insists on splitting bills, even amid his raises and spouse’s massive pay cut"," Dear Carolyn: When my husband and I first met in 2015, we both had jobs we loved and made approximately the same, about $100,000 annually each. As part of our relationship understanding, we deliberately kept our finances separate and got one joint credit card that we use for mutual expenses and pay evenly. Over the years, we both made progress in our careers and at the beginning of 2020 we were both making around $150,000 annually. Then covid hit. I lost the job I loved and have been forced to take a significant pay cut to $60,000. Meanwhile, with a few lucky breaks, he's now making well over $300,000. I'm happy for him, but he still insists we split all the bills evenly. Frankly, I can't afford it. I don't want to deny him the perks of making that kind of income, but I can't split $200 dinners out every other night or lavish vacations. I've been trying to keep up but have now been dipping into my savings and 401(k) to do so. When I try to bring the topic up, I get a lecture about how he used to make $60k (when he was 24 and lived with his parents) and made it work and that I need to be better at budgeting. I don’t know what to do. We have a happy, loving marriage otherwise, but I can’t financially kill myself either. — S. S.: He’s a terrible person. Can I just come out and say that? To quote every kid in every car ever, are we there yet? I want to respect the “happy, loving marriage otherwise,” I really do, and honor your 2015 judgment in choosing him as your spouse. I'd like to think he's just having a terrible moment. But your career got kneecapped in a global economic spasm, and Hubbums decided the proper expression of sympathy was … continued luxury-spending and a bill for half? And a lecture that glorified his 24-year-old dependent self? Unless you’re misrepresenting him somehow, that’s a first-ballot Hall of Shamer. Just to be clear — separate accounts are not the problem. There are many respectful ways to share a life. Sharing liabilities but not assets is the problem. Smug condescension is the problem. Capricious disregard for your suffering is the problem. And that joint credit card is a problem you want out of carefully and ASAP. It's also not all on him. When you first logged on to your 401(k) to appease a spouse who had apparently incurred brain/empathy damage from sniffing his own superiority, there has to have been a little bell going off somewhere in your head. One you ignored. So that’s where you start: By heeding the alarm of his cruel condescension and your capitulation to it, and standing up for yourself. Telling him where he can stuff his lecture. Your husband's lecturing does work, actually, as a kind of blueprint for you. You can start to right yourself emotionally by getting “better at budgeting,” and decline all dinners and vacations you can't afford. He can keep his perks. You can't. Reserve your money for counseling, if your new job doesn't offer an Employee Assistance Program — and for a good attorney. Both can provide support where your spouse has declined to despite his multiple, ongoing, obvious and (for him) readily affordable opportunities to behave as a life partner would. I’m sorry yours is a dud. And don’t lay another hand on your 401(k), unless it’s to get yourself free.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3rGiZ6H,"adviceperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
153,2022-02-11,CDC recommends people with weakened immune systems get booster doses after three months instead of five," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance on Friday for some people with weakened immune systems, recommending they get a booster dose of the coronavirus vaccine three months after completing the initial series of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots, rather than the current interval of five months. The guidance also said immunocompromised people who received the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine should get an additional dose. That means two doses, at least 28 days apart, followed by a booster dose of one of the mRNA vaccines. “Although COVID-19 vaccines continue to work well to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death, we have seen reduced protection against mild and moderate disease,” the agency said in a statement. “With the number of cases of COVID-19 still high across the United States and globally, this guidance helps to ensure that people have optimal protection against” the virus that causes the disease. The updated guidance also says it is no longer necessary for people to delay coronavirus vaccination after receiving treatments with monoclonal antibodies, a treatment authorized for early stage covid-19, or with convalescent plasma, which is taken from blood donated by people who have recovered from covid-19. Agency officials had presented the anticipated changes Feb. 4 during a meeting of the CDC’s outside vaccine experts on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Recommendations for some immunocompromised people are already different than those for the general population because those with frail immune systems are at increased risk for severe covid-19 and more likely to be infected even when fully vaccinated. Once infected, they can also potentially harbor mutations that could lead to more virulent new variants, experts say. The CDC recommends people with weak immune systems receive three primary shots of the mRNA vaccines plus a booster for a total of four doses. But given the less-than-optimal immune response that these individuals typically have with their first three doses, a booster at three months may provide better protection, especially amid high transmission of the omicron variant, officials have said. The CDC estimates that about 2.7 percent of adults — 7 million people — are immunocompromised, a group that includes patients with medical conditions that weaken their immune response, as well as people taking immune-suppressing drugs because of organ transplants, cancer or autoimmune diseases. Also on the list are people with advanced or untreated HIV infections, and those who have chronic medical conditions that can weaken immune response, such as chronic kidney disease.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3JpU0un,health
154,2022-02-11,"Coronavirus vaccine for young children further delayed as FDA reverses course, says it will wait for data on three doses"," The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday it will not make a decision on whether to authorize a coronavirus vaccine for children younger than 5 until data on a third dose becomes available, a delay that means it could be mid-April at the earliest before shots are available for that age group. The agency, in a surprising reversal from just 11 days earlier, said it would not move forward in considering a two-dose regimen of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, indicating that data from an ongoing trial showed the shots did not generate strong protection. The hope had been that — with surging cases sparked by the omicron variant — the data would show two shots shielded the youngest children from getting sick. That could have resulted in a prompt FDA authorization and the availability of the vaccine before the end of February. The delay is sure to be a bitter disappointment to the many parents who have been waiting anxiously for inoculations for children younger than 5 — the only people in the United States still not eligible to receive coronavirus vaccinations. While omicron appears in retreat in many parts of the country, officials have been eager to tee up a vaccine to protect children who are still vulnerable and to defend them against future versions of the virus. The FDA and the vaccine makers decided late Thursday night that the companies would not seek emergency authorization for now. A raft of two-shot data had just become available, reinforcing the shots’ safety but showing disappointing effectiveness, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe discussions among the parties. In a statement Friday, the FDA said, “Based on the agency’s preliminary assessment, and to allow more time to evaluate additional data, we believe additional information regarding the ongoing evaluation of a third dose should be considered as part of our decision-making for potential authorization.” The agency postponed an expert advisory panel meeting that had been scheduled for Tuesday to scrutinize the vaccine’s performance in children. Pfizer said data on the three-dose regimen could be available in early April, clearing the way for an FDA authorization within days or weeks. Peter Marks, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, said during a news briefing Friday that the agency “is absolutely committed” to moving as quickly as possible once the additional data is submitted. Sheila Krogh-Jespersen, an assistant professor in the department of medical social sciences at Northwestern University who has three children younger than age 3, said she has been following the progress of the vaccines closely. “Now the news today, you’ve got to be kidding!” she said. Krogh-Jespersen said most of her family tested positive for covid-19 this week, with the two older children developing high fevers. “Talk about desperation,” she said. Some experts said the FDA’s decision to delay consideration of the vaccine will prove confusing to parents. “This may very well be the right decision,” Jason L. Schwartz, associate professor of public health at the Yale School of Public Health, said. “But this has been a case of whiplash.” Tara C. Smith, an infectious-diseases expert and epidemiologist at Kent State University, tweeted, “That’s the sound of parents with under-5s screaming in unison.” But in an interview, Smith said the additional time will allow for the collection of more complete data. “It’s unlikely, after omicron, that this is all going to be over,” she said, referring to the pandemic. Some parents expressed sharp disappointment and concerns about the delay in vaccines. “Ever since the vaccine came out, we’ve been looking forward to a time when our son would be vaccinated and could start to have a normal childhood,” said Andrew, whose son is about to turn 2 and wears a mask while playing with friends at day care. Andrew spoke on the condition that only his first name be used to avoid possible harassment from anti-vaccine activists. The electrical engineer said the FDA’s decision compelled parents to continue making tough decisions even though the vaccines appear to be safe and could offer reassurance as mask mandates continue to expire and the country returns to a sense of normalcy. “It’s really just pushing the risk assessment onto the parents,” Andrew said. “In the very unlikely event that something happens with the vaccine that’s on [the FDA]. But if your kid gets sick and gets a very rare but serious complication that’s on you, the parents.” Joel Wertheimer, a first-time father who has a 4-month-old daughter, said that if the vaccine provided even a small margin of protection and is shown to be safe, he would want his child vaccinated as soon as she is eligible. “We do this all the time, we do things that increase our children’s safety by 20 percent or 30 percent … like certain car seats and certain cribs,” said Wertheimer, who lives in New York and works as a civil rights attorney and political consultant. But Sean O’Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said, “As much as I want a vaccine for these younger children, I also do think it is important to follow the process and follow the data.” He said the decision by the FDA and Pfizer was a judgment call — one that he believed “makes a lot of sense.” Katherine A. Poehling, a pediatrics professor at the Wake Forest School of Medicine and a member of CDC’s vaccine expert advisory panel, said in a statement that “following the data is sometimes challenging.” But she said if the information suggests a third dose is required for a safe and effective vaccine, “then we have learned an important insight and within a few months this data will be available to review.” Marks, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, defended the agency’s change in course, saying parents “can feel reassured” that officials won’t authorize a vaccine for the youngest Americans unless it meets high standards. Pfizer and BioNTech have been testing two shots of a 3-microgram dose in children younger than 5, a small fraction of the adult dose. Because children’s immune systems are different from adults', smaller doses are expected to trigger equivalent immune protection. The trials were designed to test the safety and efficacy of the lower dose. “Given that the study is advancing at a rapid pace, the companies will wait for the three-dose data as Pfizer and BioNTech continue to believe it may provide a higher level of protection in this age group,” the companies said Friday in a statement. “This is also supported by recent observations of three-dose booster data in several other age groups that seems to meaningfully augment neutralizing antibody levels and real-world vaccine protection for omicron compared to the two-dose regimen.” But many experts had been uneasy about the highly unorthodox regulatory strategy being considered: allowing millions of young children to begin receiving doses before the three-shot regimen was shown to be effective. Late last month, the FDA asked the vaccine makers to submit data for the two-dose regimen for young children. The idea was for regulators to start reviewing the information in hopes that a two-shot course would be at least somewhat beneficial. Officials indicated that accelerating the process could shave weeks or months off the wait for a vaccine. “Given the recent omicron surge and the notable increase in hospitalizations in the youngest children to their highest levels during the pandemic so far, we felt it was our responsibility as a public health agency to act with urgency and consider all available options, including requesting that the company provide us with initial data on two doses from its ongoing study,” Marks said in a statement Friday. “The goal was to understand if two doses would provide sufficient protection to move forward with authorizing the use of the vaccine in this age group.” It was widely expected that once the data on third shots became available, the FDA would authorize the vaccine as a three-dose regimen. During the news briefing, Marks indicated the high proportion of cases caused by the omicron variant might be partly responsible for the disappointing data for two doses. The protection afforded by the vaccine against omicron is not as great as against the delta variant, though it is still good at preventing serious disease, he said. “At the end of the day, the FDA asked for the data, Pfizer was willing to give it to them — and in the 11th hour, the decision was made: We’re not yet ready to provide that information, because it’s going to be more confusing,” said C. Buddy Creech, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program and an investigator leading a trial of the Moderna vaccine in children. “I’m a big fan of trusting the process.” Friday’s action was the latest twist in the saga of the long-awaited pediatric vaccine. In December, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the immune response generated by the vaccine in children between 2 and 4 years old was not sufficiently robust. The vaccine did provoke a strong enough response in children 6 months to 2 years old. A third shot was added to the trial to increase the immune response. The vaccine trial was designed primarily to measure whether children’s immune systems mustered a response similar to the one that protected older teens and adults from getting sick. There were about 3,900 children between 6 months and 4 years old enrolled in the trial as of Jan. 20. Third shots only started on Jan. 31, according to a presentation during Pfizer’s quarterly earnings call, so data is still being collected. Anna Wagner Schliep, the mother of a 10-month-old, said getting her son vaccinated would be the family’s ticket to a sense of normalcy, allowing them to shop in grocery stores, visit friends for play dates and even attend a few weddings set to take place this spring. Her hopes for a return to normal blossomed amid earlier reports that a vaccine for the youngest children might be available as soon as late February. When the FDA made its announcement Friday, those hopes waned. “This is just depressing,” said Wagner Schliep, 31, who works in marketing communications. “I don’t really know how to describe it other than just despair,” she said. “I try not to get too excited because I know there’s been bad news before, but you get a little excited.” Rachel Roubein, Frances Stead Sellers and Lena H.

155,2022-02-11,"Dow skids 500 points, oil prices jump as Ukraine fears intensify"," Volatility continued to rule Wall Street on Friday, with the Dow plunging more than 500 points and oil surging as investors reckoned with worrisome signs that Russia could soon invade Ukraine and growing fears about inflation. Despite a positive start to the trading day, the three major U.S. indexes reversed course in the afternoon after White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that there was a “distinct possibility” of military action within a “very swift time frame.” By the market close, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had plunged nearly 2.8 percent, or 394.49 points, to 13,791.15. The broader S&P 500 index shed 1.9 percent, or 85.44 points, to settle at 4,418.64. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.4 percent, or 503.53 points, to close at 34,737. “The Russia-Ukraine tensions have hovered over already shaky investor sentiment,” said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. “Investors have been counting on a diplomatic resolution, but recent developments indicate this may be wishful thinking and therefore, not fully priced into the markets.” Lynch said investors could be in for a rough spell if Russia goes through with an invasion. “We expect a significant bid for U.S. Treasuries, putting demand for yield in direct conflict with the Fed’s intentions,” he said. “Commodity prices may also accelerate, led by oil and gold. The dollar may also catch a safe haven bid, accelerating commodity inflation. The degree and extent of the conflict will also determine the intensity of the Fed’s tightening plans.” On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, jumped 4.4 percent to nearly $94 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed nearly 4.1 percent, above $95. Some analysts believe the Russia-Ukraine conflict could push prices above $100 a barrel. Bond yields also surged as investors priced in rate hikes, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note sailing past 2 percent to a multiyear high, before edging down slightly to 1.955 percent. Though the week began on a high note, investor mood turned dour Thursday after the Labor Department reported the largest annual inflation spike since February 1982, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve could move more aggressively than expected to raise interest rates. Such action is the Fed’s best tool to bring down prices, but the tangle of pressures surrounding and influencing inflation — a supply chain in chaos, a topsy-turvy labor market and the ongoing pandemic — will not be immediately resolved by shifts in monetary policy. In the meantime, the raising of rates will limit business activity, which often hits stocks, especially those of highflying companies, hard. “The market volatility from January is not over and we expect continued choppiness as investors weigh the prospect of a more aggressive Federal Reserve in the face of rising inflation,” Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer of Treasury Partners, said Friday in comments emailed to The Washington Post. The three major U.S. indexes remain in negative territory for 2022: The Nasdaq, which has been hit hard as investors have rotated away from pricey tech stocks, is down nearly 11.9 percent. The S&P 500 has erased nearly 7.3 percent this year, and the Dow more than 4.4 percent. Cboe’s Volatility Index, dubbed Wall Street’s fear gauge, has jumped 33 percent in the past month. Consumer sentiment declined a whopping 8.2 percent from December to January, according to the University of Michigan’s consumer confidence index, as households confronted the burdens of inflation just about everywhere. The spiking cost of food, electricity and shelter helped drive inflation higher last month. The surging costs have all but wiped out the wage gains many employers offered in a tight labor market. “Inflation remains the greatest concern for consumers,” Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said Friday in comments emailed to The Post. “Understandably so as upward pressure on prices for a wide range of goods and services has shown little evidence of abating.” Sentiments had been improving before the inflation report, as investors priced in the likelihood of several rate hikes and processed a string of economic data that suggested the coronavirus’s omicron variant cast less of a shadow over the economy than many had feared. Now, the hot inflation report has given Wall Street more to worry about. “Markets are not erring on the side of hope and are pricing in plenty more hikes in the second half of the year on the belief that the central banks will once again prove too optimistic,” Craig Erlam, senior economic analyst with OANDA, said Friday in comments emailed to The Post. “While that may lead to plenty more instability in the stock markets over the next couple of months, it could become a useful tail wind in the second half of the year if inflation does fall considerably.” Corporate earnings have been at the center of recent swings as investors looked for signs of inflation weighing on bottom lines, with performances from big names sparking steep sell-offs and big rallies.

156,2022-02-11,"Facing maximum pressure from Russia, Zelensky refuses to blink at the negotiating table "," With Russian warships and tanks encircling his country amid dire warnings from the United States about an impending invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has shown himself to be resistant to the pressure he faces from Russia — and from Europe, too. On Friday, Zelensky’s aides returned home to Kyiv after facing off with Russian counterparts in Berlin during the latest round of talks, brokered by France and Germany, aimed at ending the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. The highly technical discussions have limped along for years but took on new importance as U.S. and European officials have worked to defuse the wider Ukraine crisis resulting from Russia’s deployment of more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border. After nearly nine hours of talks this week, Ukrainian and Russian officials failed to make a breakthrough, agreeing only to continue the process and meet again at an unspecified time. “The Ukrainians presented a very hard position,” said Russian envoy Dmitry Kozak, noting that it was impossible to reconcile conflicting interpretations of an accord, known as the Minsk agreements, designed to halt the fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists. “We did not manage to overcome this,” he added. Ukraine’s envoy, Andriy Yermak, characterized his country’s approach as “constructive dialogue” and said that “everyone confirmed” the Minsk agreements must be fulfilled. A key obstacle, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions, was Kyiv’s opposition to negotiating with the pro-Russian separatists with whom they’ve been in a deadly but low-intensity conflict for the past eight years. Fighting in the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk has continued despite a cease-fire agreement. Up to 14,000 people have been killed since violence broke out in 2014. Kyiv and Moscow have accused each other of failing to implement the Minsk agreements. Ukraine views the accord as generally unfavorable to its interests and feels it was foisted upon the country’s leaders with little room for recourse. Russia has called on Ukraine to grant greater powers to the breakaway regions within Luhansk and Donetsk, an area known as the Donbas. Moscow holds that pro-Russian separatists should have a say, if not veto, over the policies of a Ukrainian federal government — a notion Kyiv opposes as it could preclude Ukraine from becoming a member of NATO or the European Union. France and Germany have tried to resuscitate the agreements by encouraging Russia and Ukraine to comply with the terms they have not implemented. For the Zelensky government, granting greater autonomy to the breakaway regions could require constitutional reforms that are deeply unpopular. Direct talks with the separatists, whom many Ukrainian officials consider “terrorists,” also are deeply controversial. On Thursday, Kozak chided the Europeans for failing to bring Ukraine into compliance. “My impression was that the Western diplomacy had no impact on the Ukrainian position in the talks,” Kozak said. Like the Ukrainians, the French and the Germans do not recognize the separatists as legitimate, but as a starting point, are encouraging the Ukrainians to engage with working groups moderated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that include some separatists, said European officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. Nikolaus von Twickel, a Berlin-based analyst who follows the breakaway territories closely, said the separatists are able to contribute some needed information about the conditions on the ground. “When you need to know the exact distance from one object to another, or who mans the water filtration station in the morning — these are very practical, very important issues,” he said. “The Moscow representatives couldn’t possibly know this.” Ukraine has signaled that it is willing to cooperate with a working group focused on humanitarian issues, but the failure to produce a joint document at the end of this week’s negotiations suggests Zelensky is holding out for better terms on a range of issues. That resistance comes despite concerns that if talks fail, Russian President Vladimir Putin could walk away from diplomacy and order a military assault on Ukraine. But Zelensky has other matters to consider as well. Zelensky could face stiff resistance in parliament to any deal seen as giving in to Russia’s demands, and which lays the groundwork for a state-within-the-state in Donbas run by Moscow’s proxies. Even granting the breakaway regions some form of special status would be highly unpopular, deputies said, and members of Zelensky’s own Servant of the People party could refuse to back the president. At the moment, no such proposal is being made, however, and deputies say they would need to see what was on the table before making their decision about how to vote. “We need to know what kind of compromise might be,” said Volodymyr Ariev, a prominent deputy with former president Petro Poroshenko’s European Solidarity party, one of the main opposition parties in Ukraine. “For a bad scenario that would harm Ukraine’s sovereignty and jeopardize [the country] — I’m pretty sure there are no votes for that.” The purpose of Russia’s interpretation of the Minsk agreements was to create a “Yalta Two” — or a division of Europe similar to what took place after World War II, Ariev said. He added that he was steadfastly opposed to a “Finlandization” of Ukraine, a reference to the neutral status of Finland during the Cold War that ensured its independence. “In looking at this situation, I understand that this is not quite comfortable for Zelensky and his team,” Ariev said. “They understand that there is no wide space for political maneuvering.” As the talks continue to stall and the threat of war grows more present, it’s unclear how much pressure the United States is placing on Ukraine to reach a compromise with Russia. French and German officials say they have the support of the United States, but a spokesperson with the National Security Council declined to offer specifics. “We stand ready to support sincere efforts at progress from all sides — Ukraine, France and Germany, and Russia — to implement the Minsk agreements,” the spokesperson said.

157,2022-02-11,"Fight crime or reform policing? As homicides spike, mayors nationwide insist they can do both. "," It was the summer of 2020, and the streets of American cities pulsed with demands to defund the police. In Baltimore, the City Council president — a young activist turned politician, Brandon Scott — led the charge to cut tens of millions of dollars from the department’s budget, arguing it was past time to “reinvest in other areas and reimagine what public safety is.” Nearly two years later, Scott is the city’s mayor. But the police budget during his tenure has gone up, not down, in the face of an onslaught of homicides that shows no signs of relenting. And Scott is adamant that the city doesn’t have to choose: It can fight violent crime while reforming law enforcement. “This is not an either-or approach,” Scott said. “It has to be both-and.” Across the country, mayors who aligned themselves with racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd by a police officer have shifted their emphasis to neighborhoods that reverberate with the sound of gunfire day and night. In major cities, leaders — most of them Democrats — are advancing plans to add police officers, target high-crime areas and roll back reforms that they say have aided criminals without enhancing equity. But they are pointedly not advocating for a return to the heavy-handed tactics of the 1980s and 1990s when, with crime peaking, city leaders and other officials competed over who could do the most to burnish no-tolerance, lock-them-up-at-all-costs credentials. Rather, they are attempting a delicate balance that weighs the demands of social justice along with the fears of citizens rattled by violent crime. In city after city, that balancing act is being put to the test. Baltimore’s Scott (D), for instance, has come under intense criticism from liberal activists disappointed that he hasn’t done more to transform the city’s police department, as well as from Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has called the mayor’s continued talk of police budget reductions “crazy.” The city just endured its highest January homicide total on record, and has logged seven straight years with 300 or more killings. In Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey (D) has been the target of demonstrations after police killed 22-year-old Amir Locke during a “no-knock” raid last week, despite the mayor’s claim to have banned such operations. “Frey lied, Amir died,” read one sign at a weekend protest in Minneapolis that drew more than 1,000 people. And in New York — perhaps the highest-profile example of efforts to navigate a middle course — Mayor Eric Adams and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, both Democrats, have offered starkly different visions of how authorities should approach criminal justice issues. Bragg, who faced intense criticism for a prosecution policy that took a more lenient approach to certain crimes, last week reversed course in some areas in response to the furor. “Mayors and police chiefs are between a rock and a hard place,” said Jeffrey Ian Ross, a University of Baltimore criminologist. Their residents want equity in policing, while also feeling exasperated that leaders “are not doing enough to decrease violent crime. They’re fed up.” Ross said there are so many factors that determine whether crime rises or falls that mayors actually have limited control — a point on which they are keenly aware. “Institutional racism is a major part of it. Poverty is a major part of it. Housing is a major part of it. It’s not just one thing,” said Ed Gainey (D), the new mayor of Pittsburgh. “People are looking for a magic wand. We don’t have a magic wand.” But Gainey and other mayors said they do have resources that weren’t previously available. Federal pandemic relief, in particular, has made it easier for cities to not have to choose between their police departments and areas such as mental health spending and community investments that they say can help curb violence. The money also allows them to experiment with new approaches. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell (D) won election last year on a pledge to grow the police force from its current size of fewer than 1,000 officers to as many as 1,400. But he also wants to create a new category of unarmed officer to handle crimes such as shoplifting, and to help dispel the image of “the macho gun-and-badge officer accosting a person of poverty.” Such ideas may not fully satisfy either liberals or conservatives, Harrell acknowledged. But he says it’s the kind of balanced approach that most voters want. “It gets loud on both ends of the spectrum,” Harrell said. “I have to be equally loud, if not louder, in the narratives I believe.” Adams — a former police captain who has advocated for reform both from within and outside the New York Police Department — has been loudest of all in arguing that public safety and social justice aren’t mutually exclusive. It’s a message that’s been eagerly embraced by President Biden, who visited Adams in New York last week to highlight the mayor’s crime-fighting plan — and to try to counter persistent Republican attacks that Democrats are responsible for the deterioration in public safety. Deadly violence has risen sharply in New York in recent years, with killings increasing from just over 300 pre-pandemic to nearly 500 in 2021. That’s still well below the 2,200 murders recorded in 1990, but Adams has made reductions in violent crime the centerpiece of his mayoral agenda. He laid out his plans not long after two police officers were fatally shot while responding to a domestic call in Harlem last month, among the seven officers shot in New York City so far this year. The mayor’s proposals include more officers on patrol, ramped-up efforts to detect guns being funneled into the city and — most controversially — “Neighborhood Safety Teams” targeting gun violence. The teams are a successor to plainclothes anti-crime units that were disbanded in 2020. Officials will “avoid mistakes of the past,” Adams said in remarks announcing his plan. “These officers will be identifiable as NYPD. They will have body cameras. And they will have enhanced training and oversight.” Christopher Ryan, a former prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said bringing those units back to the streets with proper oversight is key to helping curb gun violence. “They’re very good at patrolling in a covert way [and] are very good at knowing what is the intel of that neighborhood,” said Ryan, who is now a managing director at K2 Integrity, where he advises police departments. But the revival of the units has been derided by reform advocates, with New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman saying they arise from a lineage that had come “to symbolize the worst of abusive, racist and deadly broken-windows policing.” Broken-windows policing refers to the theory that policing minor offenses could prevent instances of more serious crime. Critics contend it has  disproportionately  criminalized some populations without reducing the overall crime rate. The divisions between Adams and Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, over bail policies and other criminal justice issues also revealed fault lines. Adams has called on the state government to undo policies imposed as part of a sweeping reform package two years ago that limited the circumstances under which judges can set bail. But Bragg, whose term also began last month, had pushed in the other direction. He issued a memo to his office’s roughly 500 attorneys last month that prohibited them from asking for bail on cases involving gun possession, as well as some assaults and robberies. Bragg also laid out plans to not pursue charges for more minor offenses, including resisting arrest, trespassing and marijuana misdemeanors. The district attorney, a lifelong resident of Harlem, where shootings have become more and more routine, has said his top priority is tackling the city’s gun crisis and has argued that by declining to charge certain other offenses, more resources can be devoted to gun violence. His memo, which was publicly released, drew immediate backlash from the police union and advocates for crime victims. Adams’s handpicked police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, told her officers she was “very concerned about the implications to your safety as police officers, the safety of the public and justice for the victims.” Bragg retreated last week, apologizing for the “confusion” and clarifying that prosecutors have discretion to make decisions outside the blueprint he had announced. Adams’s stance reflects the concerns of residents such as Kenneth Ma, a Chinatown business owner who said quality-of-life violations in the neighborhood were inviting violence — problems that he believes lenient bail policies had helped exacerbate. “I think you have to first make sure that these people don’t come back out and harm the community first before you create these policies,” said Ma, 37, whose optical store has been targeted for thefts and has had its glass door and window smashed each of the past two years. “We’re running before we learn to walk.” Ma’s experience may be one reason public opinion has shifted since Floyd was  murdered in Minneapolis nearly two years ago, with surveys from the Pew Research Center finding a drop in the share of Americans who want less funding for police in their areas. But voters have shown they want criminal justice and policing reforms, too. Last year, they beefed up police oversight in Cleveland and Albany, N.Y., scrapped no-knock warrants in Pittsburgh and, in surrounding Allegheny County, banned solitary confinement at the county jail. Bragg, meanwhile, was the latest in a wave of prosecutors who campaigned on liberal, reform-minded platforms and have won in places including Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. Some critics of liberal prosecutors have sought to link their policies to more crime and violence, but Ronald Wright, a law professor at Wake Forest University, said the evidence is lacking. “Homicide rates are up everywhere,” Wright said. “They’re up in jurisdictions that have very traditional prosecutors. They’re up in jurisdictions that have more progressive prosecutors.” Experts say the real reasons for the violent crime spike vary but probably include a combination of the pandemic, frayed community-police relations and a flood of guns. While the public debate and officials’ stances on policing and safety have shifted in recent years, some things remain stubbornly consistent. Police across the country have fatally shot more than 1,000 people in each of the last two years, according to a Washington Post database, a toll that remains steady despite the protests, calls for reform and ongoing pandemic. Minneapolis police added to the toll Feb. 2 when an officer shot and killed Locke. Body-camera footage shows Locke apparently asleep on a couch. An officer appears to bump the couch, and Locke, wrapped in a blanket, is seen attempting to rise while holding a gun pointed at the ground as SWAT team officers, executing a no-knock warrant, burst into the apartment. Three gunshots ring out. Police said Locke was not the subject of the warrant. Frey immediately came under scrutiny for claiming to have banned no-knock warrants in the city. A closer look at the policy revisions he implemented in late 2020, after Floyd’s death, revealed that the language allowed police to continue using them. Last week, after Locke’s death, Frey again announced a moratorium — but in the fine print allowed the department to use them if officers deemed the situation an “imminent threat.” Frey was reelected last year and claimed the victory validated his “both/and” approach to reform and public safety. “We need deep and structural change to policing in America. At the same time, we need police officers to make sure that they are working directly with community to keep us safe,” he proclaimed on election night. “All of these things are true.” But the killing of Locke has only further inflamed intense debate in a city experiencing rising violent crime along with a surge of officer departures that has left the police department struggling to respond to 911 calls. Minneapolis reported 96 homicides in 2021 — a number that tied a record in the 1990s, when the city was dubbed “Murderapolis.” The deaths include several young children on the city’s predominantly Black north side, where residents have complained about the lack of police. Last month, Frey announced that he was accelerating police recruitment, with a goal to quickly hire around 200 new officers, though he has described the effort as a “heavy lift,” pointing to recruiting challenges felt nationwide. The need to hire so many officers so quickly has raised concerns about the quality of officers who will be on the streets. “Police officers need to get paid more and fired more. They need to get paid more so that we are incentivizing the best, most talented, community-oriented officers to sign up for what, yes, is a very, very hard job,” Frey said last month. “And we need to make sure that when those officers do not live up to the values that we have instilled and that we are insisting on, they are fired.” Police unions nationwide have resisted such efforts. Tom Saggau, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said his union has pushed for reform and is willing to work with activists on areas of possible common ground, including a national use-of-force standard. “It’s not rocket science to see that there are people in law enforcement who don’t have the temperament to be in law enforcement,” he said. Saggau said, however, his union would not endorse reforms that come “at the expense of making communities less safe.” To Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter’s Los Angeles chapter, police officers themselves are often the source of insecurity — which is one reason she favors cutting their funding. “I don’t know a Black person on this Earth who feels safer when a police cruiser pulls up behind them in traffic,” she said. Scott, the Baltimore mayor, knows that fear, having grown up in the city’s rough-and-tumble Pimlico neighborhood where, he said, officers would “sit you down on the curb just for being human.” The 37-year-old, who is Black, has also lost friends to gun violence — including one just last year, an anti-violence activist named Dante Barksdale. “He was like a brother to me,” Scott said. Now his friend’s memory is an inspiration for Scott’s efforts to keep pushing for both reform and public safety. When critics assail his plans, “I can hear Dante in my ear, saying, ‘Hell no, Brandon. You got to go further,’” he said. While the mayor hasn’t reduced the police budget, he has limited increases to the minimum required for cost-of-living adjustments. And he has directed new funding to programs he sees as alternatives to the police — including the “violence interruption” work of which Barksdale was a part. Investments from City Hall in addiction recovery, affordable housing and job training, he said, can be as effective as anything in reducing the homicide rate. “People want constitutional policing at the same time they want community health programs,” he said. “We’re creating the complete ecosystem.” Jacobs reported from New York City, and Bailey reported from Minneapolis.

158,2022-02-11,Fire company suspended after allegedly mocking police killing of 8-year-old girl," A Philadelphia area volunteer fire company is under investigation after members allegedly mocked the death of an 8-year-old girl fatally shot by police last year and made racial slurs and remarks against colleagues and the area’s Black community. Officials in Delaware County, Pa., announced Thursday that the Briarcliffe Fire Company has been suspended for 30 days after volunteer firefighters were involved in a racist conversation following a virtual meeting last month. Michael Pierce, solicitor for Darby Township, Pa., told The Washington Post that the allegations came to light after the Goodwill Fire Company, another volunteer firehouse in the area, submitted a letter summarizing the Jan. 27 incident to the Darby Township Board of Commissioners on Wednesday. Members of the Briarcliffe Fire Company are accused of using the n-word and other racial slurs toward firefighters from Darby Township Station 4, the township’s third volunteer firehouse. Some members joked about how it was “time to leave” the area because more Black people were moving there, according to audio posted by the community organization Delco Resists. Multiple people are also heard on the audio mocking and laughing at Fanta Bility, an 8-year-old Black girl who was fatally shot by three police officers outside a high school football game near Philadelphia last August. Pierce said the alleged behavior presented to the board was “unacceptable.” “If the summaries presented at the meeting were correct, then something needed to happen,” he said. The names of those allegedly involved have not been released, and it’s unclear how many Briarcliffe members were implicated in the conversation. The allegations were denounced by public officials as an example of “systemic racism and entrenched racism.” “Whether or not a crime occurred, hate speech is always morally wrong,” Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said at a Thursday news conference, noting that the investigation would look into whether any criminal activities were connected to the conversation. Bruce Castor Jr., the attorney for Bility’s family, said the child’s relatives were “appalled” by the allegations and called for those involved in the conversation to be disciplined. “A kind and loving girl, Fanta brightened the lives of everyone she met,” he wrote in a statement. “To speak of her with such disrespect shines the light of shame on those people at the firehouse making the remarks, and reflects negatively on those good and true first responders who pledge their lives to the service of all members of the community.” Messages left for the Briarcliffe Fire Company were not immediately returned Friday. The volunteer group’s Facebook page appears to have been deleted. Messages left for the Goodwill Fire Company were not immediately returned. The news surrounding the Briarcliffe Fire Company comes weeks after three officers were charged in Bility’s death Aug. 27 in Sharon Hill, a suburb of Philadelphia. Sharon Hill police officers Devon Smith, Sean Dolan and Brian Devaney were charged with 12 counts of manslaughter and reckless endangerment for killing Bility when they fired 25 shots in response to a gunfight between Angelo “AJ” Ford, 16, and Hasein Strand, 18. The Delaware County District Attorney’s Office had been under pressure from many activist groups and local Democratic officials to name Smith, 34, Dolan, 25, and Devaney, 41, and charge them after the teens were charged with first-degree murder among other counts in the gunfight that precipitated the officers’ response. Attorneys for the officers have maintained their innocence. The Briarcliffe Fire Company in Darby Township, about 10 miles outside downtown Philadelphia, has served the community for more than 50 years, Pierce said. All of the area’s volunteer fire companies have previously been suspended for various indiscretions, he said, “but none related to race, threats or allegations like this.” A fire survey meeting was held over Zoom on Jan. 27 with Briarcliffe and other local fire companies, including Goodwill, Pierce said. After most of the participants logged out of the meeting, several Briarcliffe members who were unaware that they were still being recorded began using what the letter described as “foul, inappropriate language.” “That’s what … bothers me, Blacks taking over,” one person said, according to audio. At one point, someone points out how another volunteer company has “a lot of Black members” who are “taking over the fire company.” At another point in the conversation, multiple people are heard laughing after someone said, “Little Fanta Bility, the girl that got shot.” Later in the recording, someone is heard joking about the late girl’s name and how it’s spelled like Fanta soda. “Fanta soda, yeah, orange or Fanta grape,” the member said. In addition, one Briarcliffe member also threatened to physically assault a Goodwill official, according to audio. About two weeks later, Goodwill presented a memo of the call to Darby Township commissioners at a Wednesday board meeting. Once the allegations were presented in great detail, Pierce said it did not take long for the board to unanimously agree that the fire company should be suspended. When Delco Resists posted the audio to its Facebook page Thursday night, the group said the community deserved better. “The disregard for Fanta’s life strikes at the core of the community’s faith in public servants and demands systemic reform across the entire county, at every level of government,” the group wrote. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D) described the allegations Thursday as “a betrayal of public trust.” Several other officials, including state Sen. Anthony Williams (D), joined in decrying the alleged actions of the volunteer fire company. “That is an example of what systemic racism and entrenched racism looks like,” he told reporters. Though the suspension is for 30 days, it could be longer if the investigation is not completed in that time, Pierce said. Timothy Boyce, director of Delaware County’s Department of Emergency Services, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that there would be no gaps in fire services because of the suspension. Pierce stressed that he wanted to see what the district attorney’s investigation finds — and whether it confirms the allegations that has left his community stunned and concerned. “I’m not prepared to condemn a volunteer fire company that has been around for many years over the actions of a few people,” he said. “But if the information presented to the board is found to be true, then they get what they deserve.” Annabelle Timsit contributed to this report.

159,2022-02-11,"For Chinese still trapped in the pandemic, the Olympics give a spark of pride"," For Beijing resident Karen Bai, these past two years have been difficult. Her employer, an education consultancy, has struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic, with fewer students looking to study overseas. The 36-year-old has battled illness and has been unable to get vaccinated against the coronavirus because she is immunocompromised. For Bai, the Olympics have been a welcome distraction from these tough realities and a reminder that she and her country are making progress. The last time Beijing hosted the Olympics, in 2008, she didn’t even own a TV. Now she owns an apartment in the capital city’s suburbs. “Watching the Winter Olympics this year, I really feel that China has become stronger,” she said. “I’m proud to be Chinese.” Bai’s experiences reflect the wide-ranging emotions of many across China watching the Games. On one hand, the glossy international show has little to do with the exhausting reality of a third year of lockdowns, mass coronavirus testing and closed borders. The Olympics are taking place in a bubble, with the athletes walled off from the rest of Beijing and no tickets sold to China’s general public. And yet, many people are looking for distraction and cheer amid the pandemic, and the Games have served that purpose. The throwback comparisons to 2008 have people reflecting on the fact that they, and their country, have become wealthier and worldlier. China’s economy has more than tripled in size, and a massive swath of the population has emerged from poverty into the middle class. “My ‘Moments’ that night was basically full of five-star red flags,” Chen Han, 19, a sports education major in Changsha, said about his friends’ patriotic social media posts on WeChat Moments during the Opening Ceremonies. Tian Chang, a 30-year-old Beijing resident, said she felt particularly emotional when China’s Ren Ziwei won the men’s short-track speedskating competition, in a chaotic final dash that made her so nervous she leaped up and mimicked the skaters in front of the TV. “I just felt that we the Chinese people are good at accomplishing the impossible in the face of adversity,” she said. Tian said the Beijing Games spurred her to begin learning how to ski. China is not a democracy, and its domestic press and Internet are censored, which means it has not seen the kind of the vigorous debate typical in host countries over whether the gargantuan cost of the Games is worth it. But public alienation from the glitzy show comes out in more subtle ways, including some people simply not watching the Games, as well as a flood of grass-roots concern in recent days over a woman found chained in a village. Shortly before the Olympics began, a video went viral on the Chinese Internet of a mother chained by her neck inside a shed outside her home. While the horrifying case had nothing to do with the Olympics, many commentators drew a comparison, saying that the plight of the nation’s poor and powerless must not be forgotten amid the celebration of famous athletes. “I often feel like I live in a very fragmented world,” one Weibo user commented. “With the Lunar New Year and Winter Olympics, it’s full of song and dance. And yet at the same time, such a horrific thing can happen so easily to an ordinary person.” Chinese viewers have not been able to wholly ignore the political clashes surrounding the Olympics, despite state media playing down the protests. The United States and several other countries are staging a diplomatic boycott of the Games, citing China’s human rights violations, especially against members of the Uyghur ethnic minority in the northwestern Xinjiang region. In an apparent retort, Beijing chose a Uyghur cross-country skier to be one of the two final torchbearers for the Opening Ceremonies. The move rankled some domestic audiences. A 27-year-old woman in Shanghai who would give only her surname as Cui said the move felt too political. “It makes me not want to watch the Winter Olympics because there’s a lot of politics going on here,” she said. “In 2008, they chose Li Ning, a well-known gymnast who has had brilliant achievements. But this girl, who ever has heard of her? Who is she? She’s there just because she’s Uyghur. For me, all these politics are quite annoying.” More inspiring has been U.S.-born freestyle skier Eileen Gu, who competed for Team China and has been broadly popular among Chinese audiences as a glamorous symbol of the nation’s growing soft power. At one point shortly after the 18-year-old won gold in the women’s big air event, a third of the 50 trending hashtags on China’s Weibo social media platform were about her. “I’ve been chatting with my sisters in a WeChat group, and we’re still chatting today about Eileen Gu’s competition,” said Liu Longyan, 23, a construction company employee in the southern city of Chengdu. “She is really awesome.” Many children and their parents were among those watching the Olympics in China, with schools assigning it as part of patriotic education. “My son’s teacher asked him to watch the Olympics Opening Ceremonies, to cultivate patriotic pride and encourage the children to participate in winter sports,” said Zhang Jianqian, 45, a resident of the northern port city of Tianjin. Chinese education officials have expressed hopes that winter sports can help youngsters build character, as they have grown up in affluence and need an “awareness of struggle,” according to a commentary by Beijing Sport University Chairman Cao Weidong. The Olympics came this year on the heels of the Lunar New Year, China’s largest annual holiday. For the third year in a row, Chinese officials urged people to stay in place instead of seeing their families to cut down on the risk of coronavirus infection. Zhang said he wasn’t able to return to his hometown in Hubei province this year because of the risk of getting caught in a lockdown if a localized outbreak emerged. Pandemic controls have been tight in Tianjin in recent months, partly because of its proximity to Beijing, with the city imposing targeted lockdowns and several rounds of mass testing. In the space of 11 days in January, Zhang was asked to take four coronavirus tests. Winter sports such as skiing have only begun to become popular in China in recent years. Zhang said his wife and son sometimes go skiing at a resort north of Tianjin, but he has yet to adopt the hobby. “I’m not really interested in winter sports,” Zhang said, “nor have I been skiing because it costs money, and it’s quite expensive.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3LueK64,asia
160,2022-02-11,"Gov. Ron DeSantis scrambles Florida’s redistricting debate, with an eye to 2022 and perhaps 2024 elections"," Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has cast himself as the nation’s boldest and most aggressively conservative Republican leader, his eye on a 2022 reelection campaign and a potential presidential run two years later. DeSantis last month introduced legislation that would allow parents to sue if schools taught critical race theory. He has sued the Biden administration for releasing immigration detainees in his state. And he has repeatedly championed his refusal to require mask-wearing, to mandate vaccines or to push for business closures throughout the pandemic. It nonetheless shocked even fellow Florida Republicans when, in the midst of a pressure campaign from Donald Trump’s former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon, DeSantis incited a redistricting battle with his own party, roping the state’s two legislative chambers into the fray and asking the state’s highest court to pick sides. Days before the Florida state Senate was to vote on new congressional district lines in January, DeSantis presented a dramatically more partisan map that boosted Republican seats and eliminated a district where a plurality of voters are Black. The state Senate ignored DeSantis’s last-minute appeal and passed its version, a map that received support from every Republican and all but four Democrats in the chamber. DeSantis responded by asking the state Supreme Court to weigh in on whether his map’s erasure of the 5th Congressional District, where Black Democrats are advantaged, would withstand legal scrutiny. The move froze the state House’s redistricting work, which was set to begin soon after. On Thursday, in a rare legal setback for DeSantis, the state Supreme Court rejected his request for an advisory opinion, saying the governor’s request was “broad and contains multiple questions that implicate complex federal and state constitutional matters and precedents interpreting the Voting Rights Act of 1965.” DeSantis’s spokeswoman, Taryn Fenske, said in a statement that the governor had been “hopeful the Supreme Court would provide clarity to legal questions surrounding the maps” and that DeSantis looks forward to working with legislators to craft new district lines. Within hours of the court’s rejection, the state House’s redistricting committee released a map that overwhelmingly favored Republicans — but unlike DeSantis’s version, kept the 5th Congressional District intact, setting up another round pitting the legislators and their maps against their party’s governor. The district at the center of the fight stretches some 200 miles across Florida’s northern border from Jacksonville to Tallahassee. The area was home to some of Florida’s wealthiest antebellum cotton plantations, made prosperous on the backs of enslaved Black people. DeSantis released his map decimating that district on the eve of the holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. “This is an east-west district that protects African Americans that descend from the pre-Civil War Florida,” said Matthew Isbell, a Democratic redistricting expert. “They finally had political representation.” For the past five years, Rep. Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, has represented the district. He unseated incumbent Corrine Brown — another Black Democrat who had represented a different configuration of the district since 1993 — in a 2016 primary. “I didn’t know it was coming,” Lawson said of the governor’s proposal to abolish his district. “It was unusual; in all the years I’ve never seen a governor’s office submit a plan. The mind-set should be what is best for the people in a particular area, not what’s best for the party, and that’s often been hard for Republicans.” George Gillis, 76, who serves as chairman of the deacons at Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church in Jacksonville, said he is concerned about DeSantis’s motives for slicing up the district where he lives and prays. Under DeSantis’s plan, Black voters in the district would be dispersed among four Republican seats, all currently represented by White conservatives. “A lot of Black people turned out to vote, and now the governor is looking for ways to turn that around. I have a feeling he’s looking at a presidential run, and he has this new map that he thinks could help him,” Gillis said. “He’s trying to rig the system, to put it very bluntly.” DeSantis’s general counsel Ryan Newman defended the governor’s map, saying the 5th Congressional District as it is now drawn is a “flagrant gerrymander.” The current map was crafted in 2015 by a panel of judges who determined a previous iteration by the legislature was overtly partisan. “We had legal concerns with the congressional redistricting maps under consideration in the legislature,” Newman said. “We submitted an alternative proposal, which we can support, that adheres to federal and state requirements and addresses our legal concerns, while working to increase district compactness, minimize county splits where feasible and protect minority voting populations.” Florida’s current delegation in the U.S. House has 16 Republicans and 11 Democrats. The state’s population growth in the 2020 Census earned it an additional seat. The map passed by the state Senate has 16 districts that would have been won by Trump and 12 that would have been won by President Biden. The DeSantis proposal has 18 Trump seats to 10 that voted for Biden, and in two of the Biden districts, the Democrat won by less than one percentage point. In a good political year for Republicans, as this year is expected to be, Republicans could win 20 out of 28 seats in a state Trump won by just three percentage points. Unlike other Republican-controlled states that maximized their partisan advantage through redistricting a decade ago, Florida’s Republican skew was limited by the court’s 2015 redrawing. With little room to move elsewhere, national Republicans this year saw Florida as one of their best opportunities to draw new GOP seats. “If I were to guess what is going on here, there’s pressure upon the governor to help Republican interests nationally,” said Michael McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida. “He has aspirations to run for the [presidential] nomination in 2024, so he doesn’t want to look like he’s not standing up for Republicans; here’s a fairly low-cost way for him to do that.” DeSantis’s critics have slammed the governor for publicly inserting himself into the redistricting process and seeking legal input before a final map is passed. “This is by far, I think, the most aggressive action we’ve seen from any Republican governor in the country when it comes to redistricting, and for me to say that is significant, given the way in which Republican governors have conducted themselves over the course of this cycle in Republican legislatures,” said Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general under President Barack Obama, who leads an advocacy organization for national Democratic redistricting efforts. DeSantis’s redistricting moves coincided with the concerted campaign against the state Senate map by far-right Republicans angry that Florida’s Republican-controlled government wasn’t using its mapmaking power to draw more GOP seats at a time when control of the House rests on a handful of races. Bannon, now the host of “War Room” — a six-day-a-week podcast popular among Trump devotees — started by publicly pressuring state legislators to draw more districts that Trump would have won easily. Days before DeSantis dropped his surprise map, the “War Room” account on Gettr, the social media site favored by many Trump fans, asked followers to contact the governor “and tell him to [stay] focused on redistricting in his state to be sure MAGA gets these seats.” Christian Ziegler, the vice chairman of the Florida GOP, traveled to Arizona last month for a Trump rally and said he was repeatedly approached by strangers in the crowd. “I was wearing my Florida GOP jacket, and throughout the day, I can’t even tell you how many people came up to me asking about the congressional maps in Florida and asking whether DeSantis was going to get involved,” Ziegler said. “It’s very popular with the base,” he continued. “You have a Republican official standing up and fighting for the conservative cause because they want to win.” Bannon took credit for DeSantis’s move, saying on his podcast in January that he and his supporters’ pressure campaign made the governor weigh in with a more partisan map. “It’s DeSantis and the guys down in Florida listening,” Bannon said on his show, adding that “the map came out, and this is 100 percent [due to] the ‘War Room’ and particularly all the great citizens down in Florida.” “We love the fact that you called and had your voices heard,” he said. “Look at what happened.” But voting rights groups were not celebrating DeSantis’s attempt to influence the final map. Cecile Scoon, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, called the governor’s involvement “an unwelcome surprise.” Her organization led the successful lawsuit against the legislature-drawn congressional map after the 2010 Census. It was also instrumental in promoting an amendment to Florida’s constitution to take partisanship out of redistricting, which voters overwhelmingly approved in 2010. “It’s really baffling,” she said, “and it’s a powerful statement in a negative way that a governor of a Southern state would do anything that openly and obviously harms the voting rights of many minority groups.” DeSantis, asked about his map at a recent news conference, said his concerns about the lines were “mostly legal issues, it’s not really political issues,” and then pivoted to bashing congressional maps drawn by New York and Illinois Democrats, which he called “unbelievable monstrosities.” Adam Kincaid, who runs the Republicans’ national redistricting effort, would not comment on the map passed by the state Senate or the one proposed by DeSantis, but he called the governor’s draft a “completely legal congressional proposal.” But other Republicans are less convinced. State Sen. Ray Rodrigues, who chairs the chamber’s redistricting committee, said he was unaware of DeSantis’s map before it was released publicly. He said he had heard grumbling from some conservatives about the bipartisan congressional map he shepherded, but no one had approached him about it directly. Rodrigues said senators took care to draw a map that would survive court scrutiny, unlike their effort a decade ago. He said the bipartisan map follows the criteria in the 2010 constitutional amendment, which says new boundaries shouldn’t favor one political party or incumbent and cannot diminish the opportunity of minorities to elect a candidate of their choice. “I’m a proud Republican, a very conservative Republican, but when I was elected, I was sworn into office on an oath to follow and protect the Constitution whether I like it or not,” he said. “I have a responsibility to be in compliance with our Constitution.” Rep. Kelly Skidmore, the top Democratic member on the state House congressional redistricting committee, said the governor’s proposal was inappropriate, unconstitutional and violates the federal Voting Rights Act. “The way the governor behaves is modeled after former president Trump in terms of, ‘I can do whatever I want and the rules and protocols be damned,’ ” Skidmore said. DeSantis’s next move is unclear. He retains veto power over any compromise bill passed by the legislature. “Whether or not the map becomes law, it still doesn’t matter for him, he’ll get the credit for fighting for it,” Democratic redistricting consultant Isbell said. “It’s a cynical ploy to ingratiate himself with a very activist base. It’s important he not be viewed as caving. He probably saw the risk that if he signed a pretty fair map, he’d be viewed as a traitor.” Adrián Blanco and Harry Stevens contributed to this report.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3oJfSJz,politics
161,2022-02-11,"Hard hit by omicron, New York City shows the ongoing benefit of vaccination"," It has not been a great winter in New York City. Winter in New York City is never great, granted, but the pandemic meant less enthusiasm for the sorts of indoor activity that make winters in the city more palatable and a massive surge in cases that infected more than 900,000 city residents — by far the most recorded cases since the pandemic began. More than 4,000 people have died in the city since winter began. Yet there is a sliver of good news that emerges from this darkness. The comprehensive data compiled by the New York City Health Department indicate that, even with the advent of the omicron variant, vaccines are effective at reducing the risk of infection, hospitalization and death. The city data are offered both as relative values — that is, number of cases or deaths within a population — and as raw totals. It’s useful for us to begin by looking at those raw counts, because it demonstrates one of the common misunderstandings surrounding the pandemic response. Weekly data on the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in the city indicate something surprising: It was often the case that there were more new infections in a week among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated. On the graph below, the size of the circle indicates the number of cases within each group during the indicated week. A bigger circle means more cases. (The three most recent weeks of data are incomplete.) There may be reasons that the numbers look this way that aren’t related to actual infection rates. The unvaccinated, for example, might be less likely to seek out a test when they suspect they contracted the virus, given everything we know about how vaccination status overlaps with efforts to treat the virus seriously in other ways. But the above data also obscure the fact that the city has far more vaccinated people than unvaccinated. If we show the number of cases within each population relative to the total pool of residents, the picture changes dramatically. This is the important set of data. If you learn that 100 people have emigrated to South America, that means something different if it’s out of the population of the United States than if it’s out of the newsroom of The Washington Post. So look at the week of Jan. 8, for example. In that week, there were 61 percent more cases among the unvaccinated, according to the city data, but it represented a far larger percentage of the total pool of unvaccinated people than did the new cases among the vaccinated — nearly nine times as much of the population. The city’s data allow us to compare per-capita cases, hospitalizations and deaths during the past several months directly. In each case, the unvaccinated were hit harder, but particularly when considering hospitalizations and deaths. (Here, too, we may see the effects of diverging responses to infection: Unvaccinated who get sick might not test themselves, but if they’re sick enough to go to the hospital they’ll be tested there.) At the bottom of that graph, you can see the ratio of per-capita cases, hospitalizations and deaths among the unvaccinated to the vaccinated. The higher the bars, the bigger the difference. The omicron variant became a majority of cases in New York City in the middle of December. Since then, by my calculations, the unvaccinated have been about four times as likely to be infected, six times as likely to be hospitalized and seven times as likely to die of covid-19. This is not a coincidence.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/368iE4B,"politicsanalysiscloseanalysis interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events"
162,2022-02-11,I wanted kids but never had them. Could playing Cupid make up for it?," I had a knack for setting up my friends and family, and enough of the pairs turned into successful marriages that I began to think of myself as an amateur matchmaker. I introduced my Michigan brother Brian to a New York girlfriend, and after he proposed, she told me, “You’re one of the magic people.” They had four kids in a row — one girl and three boys — just like my parents. I was happy for them, but I was still single. I hated being a relationship fairy who couldn’t find a relationship. “Your matches earn you a condominium in heaven,” my mother consoled. But I wanted a cohabitor in this lifetime to start my own family. Luckily, my good couples’ karma paid off when a married pal set me up with a tall, curly haired hilarious fellow writer. Six years later, he laughed when his 35-year-old bride wore black. Grateful I’d found my bashert (Yiddish for destiny), I became a fix-up fanatic, matching up all the solo players I knew, hosting singles soirees and publishing a book sharing advice for finding long-lasting passion. I even appeared on a reality TV show fixing up a famous musician. My services were free, and, like my mother, I served great buffets at parties. It was easy to be generous when I felt blessed. But then infertility hit. I loved watching what amazing grandparents my folks were. Yet it was difficult seeing the offspring of the couples I’d matched when I couldn’t have kids with the man I adored. I felt like a biological tragedy. Since my husband was 11 years my senior and our creative careers were in flux, he insisted we were too old and financially unstable to risk extensive fertility treatments or adopt. Teaching popular nonfiction classes at a nearby university, I was resigned to having students and books, not babies. But when my father — a doctor — kept referring to his kids and grandkids as his lasting legacy, I suddenly feared I’d have nothing to leave the planet but a few hardcovers (that didn’t even sell very well). Turning 50, I felt like a flop. At least I was strong and healthy, I told myself. Then, working out, I tore two ligaments in my lower back. Depressed, I could barely walk to classes down urban streets where my legs once sped. A doctor referred me to Kenan, a young physical therapist with an unfamiliar accent. A nosy journalist bored with the tedious exercises, I asked him questions. Learning he was a Bosnian Muslim war survivor exiled from his homeland when he was 12 knocked the edge off my self-pity. “You should write about your past,” I told him, fascinated. “Don’t remember much,” he snapped. “I keep to my chest.” The next session, Kenan handed me 43 pages that had poured out of him. It ended with the memory of his mother trying to record the dramatic saga of how they’d survived. She’d died of cancer before finishing. After I helped him publish an essay, he sat in my publishing seminar, where a literary agent offered to represent him. “I work full time. English isn’t my first tongue. Never wrote anything but patient reports,” Kenan worried. I became Kenan’s ongoing patient, teacher, co-author and Jewish mom. Shy and a little closed off emotionally, he was clear he didn’t want me to try my matchmaking habit on him. He focused on fixing my spine; I fixed his grammar and punctuation. When he told me he’d left his homeland before he was old enough to date, I mirrored his young male voice and wrote “I never kissed a girl from home.” The lament embarrassed him, as did the dazzling author photo I snapped of him in a light blue shirt on my roof against the New York skyline. I didn’t tell him that publicly announcing what you want was one of my secret strategies to attract love. Indeed, that kiss-less line and photograph led to many female fans. Mirela, a Sarajevan beauty, messaged Kenan on social media, moved by the traumas he’d shared in his memoir that she’d also struggled to overcome. “What are you waiting for? Get on a plane!” I pushed, his personal yenta. When they married three years ago, I took partial credit for the match, adding it to the duets and families who were together because of me. (“You have 30 kids but no stretch marks,” a friend quipped.) As I embraced my position as a professor and wrote more serious books — including a new Bosnia chronicle with Kenan — my matchmaking receded. After my husband’s knee surgery, Kenan became his physical therapist, too. He and Mirela felt like kin, especially when they moved two blocks from us during the pandemic, with all our blood relatives living far away. We were overjoyed to learn they were having a baby. In August, Kenan met my brother Brian on his visit to help his youngest son, Abe, move into his New York University dorm. “If I hadn’t picked NYU, you wouldn’t be born,” I told my nephew, explaining how an NYU professor had recommended the job where I’d met his mom. This bright, handsome college kid seemed like a miraculous byproduct of a good deed decades before. After losing my father four years ago, it felt poignant to see his youngest grandson studying pre-med at his alma mater, following in his footsteps. Before they left town, my husband and I took Brian out for his birthday to a nearby cafe, assuming Abe would be too busy with school orientation to come. “I’m not in the position to turn down a free meal,” Abe joked. I suspected his generous heart wouldn’t allow him to miss his dad’s big day. Halfway through Brian’s birthday dinner, Kenan texted me a picture. His newborn son. Lukman arrived on the same day that Brian had entered the universe. Coincidentally, both also came out feet first. We toasted Brian and Lukman’s shared birthday, along with Abe following my father’s footsteps. I looked at my husband wistfully, wishing we’d had children together. “Abe and Lukman wouldn’t be alive without you,” he whispered. Riding home in a rainstorm before a hurricane hit, it seemed like a message from the universe that my matchmaking sideline might be my legacy, as if there were many ways to bring life into the world.

163,2022-02-11,‘Innocent victim’: Russians roiled by teenage skater doping controversy," MOSCOW — The failed doping test and potential Olympic ban of a Russian figure skating star in Beijing has embroiled Moscow in another high-stakes sports scandal, enraging officials and fans at home. Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old skater who became the first woman ever to land a quadruple jump at the Olympics, is awaiting a decision on whether she will be allowed to participate in the women’s individual competition next week. She had been favored to take gold. While she awaits an expedited hearing from the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Russian sports commentators, Olympic viewers and government officials recoiled from the news, with many expressing sympathy for the teenager. “Valieva became a pawn in a big political game. She is an innocent victim of the Olympics in China,” journalist Yekaterina Avdonina wrote in an op-ed for Championat, one of Russia’s leading sports outlets, referring to the potential carelessness of Valieva’s coaches. “It will be very difficult to clear the skater’s reputation even if she is miraculously acquitted,” Avdonina added. “The worst thing about this situation is that Kamila’s guilt is minimal. She trusted the wrong people and paid the price.” Valieva’s failed test, from a sample taken Dec. 25, wasn’t reported by the Swedish laboratory until this week. According to the International Testing Agency, the Russian Anti-Doping Agency provisionally suspended Valieva, but then an RUSADA disciplinary committee lifted the suspension after Valieva challenged it. It isn’t clear why the test results were not reported for weeks, and Russian officials have seized upon that delay. “I have serious questions about the time period that passed between December 25, when the sample was taken in St. Petersburg, and February 8, when it was made public,” Russian Olympic Committee head Stanislav Pozdnyakov told state media Friday. “It is very likely that someone withheld this sample until the end of the team competition of the skaters.” On Feb. 8, the day after Valieva led the Russians to victory in the Olympic figure skating team competition, the Swedish lab said that it detected trimetazidine in her sample, according to the ITA. The drug, which isn’t approved for use in the United States, improves blood flow and is used to treat heart conditions. It could also help athletes recover faster, although its benefits have been little studied. The Kremlin spokesman weighed in on the scandal, signaling that Valieva has the backing of Russian leadership. “We support our Kamila Valieva, completely and without limits, and we encourage everyone to support her,” presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Friday in a call with reporters. “And we say to Kamila: Kamila, do not hide your face, you are Russian, walk proudly everywhere and, most importantly, perform and defeat everyone.” Leaving the rink on Friday, Valieva covered her face with a hood when asked questions by journalists. Valieva is part of a prominent group of skaters coached by Eteri Tutberidze, who has faced criticism for allegedly putting young athletes under excessive pressure and forcing them to perform physically demanding jumps years before their peers from other countries. Several Tutberidze proteges have achieved impressive results at young ages before leaving the sport before the age of 20. Three years ago, Tutberidze said in a television interview that she doesn’t consider meldonium — another blood flow medication — to be a doping drug, and that after its 2014  World Anti-Doping Agency ban, her team had to look for a new drug with similar properties to help athletes recover. Russian athletes have not been able to perform in international competitions under their country’s flag and anthem in recent years because of a state-run doping program used during the 2014 Sochi Winter Games. The World Anti-Doping Agency in 2019 banned Russia from international competition for four years. The Court of Arbitration for Sport later reduced the ban to two years, but that scandal has hovered over this case. “In Russia, the news [about Valieva], of course, causes disappointment and devastation. In the world — laughter and gloating,” sports commentator Mikhail Chesalin wrote. “And if we in Russia will try to understand the situation, soften it and take into account all the details, the West will most likely form a simple and understandable position: ‘The Russians are doping again.’ ” The head of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, told Reuters that the United States could prosecute the Russians involved in Valieva’s doping case under the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, further agitating the Kremlin. Peskov slammed Tygart’s statement, saying that Russia is “categorically against any transborder enforcement of U.S. law, either in sports or in any other field.” Ordinary Russians, still indignant over the damage Russian sports sustained after the Sochi scandal, resented the news about Valieva’s possible ban, linking it to Russia’s standoff with the West. “Of course! If [our team] hadn’t won the medal, no one would’ve said anything, but now they have decided to stir things up,” one commentator wrote under a Sports.Ru Instagram post about Valieva’s suspension. “Too bad that sports became a part of dirty world politics,” another user wrote.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3oDLWyb,europe
164,2022-02-11,"IRS backlog hits nearly 24 million returns, further imperiling the 2022 tax filing season "," Nearly 24 million taxpayers are still waiting for the Internal Revenue Service to process their tax returns from last year — a number far larger than previously reported by the agency — with many refunds being held up for 10 months or more. The inventory of unprocessed returns and related correspondence was provided by the IRS’s taxpayer advocate service to the tax-writing committees in Congress. The backlog will probably further slow service in the 2022 filing season; the Treasury Department, the IRS’s parent agency, warned in January that it expected its response to be subpar this year. The pileup of work that remains from last year, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not approved to speak publicly, comes as the tax agency struggles to hire and train new staff to clear the logjam. In response, the IRS is considering suspending tax collections and excusing some penalty enforcement. The troubles also have generated bipartisan angst on Capitol Hill, although lawmakers have found themselves once again torn over how exactly to improve the agency’s performance. A group of 30 Republicans described the situation as “untenable” in a letter sent this week to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. But some in the GOP simultaneously are working to block any new federal aid that might help the beleaguered agency — a stance that drew sharp criticism from Democrats on Saturday. “For decades, Republicans have starved the IRS of funding, and now American taxpayers are paying the price,” said Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), the chairman of the tax-focused House Ways and Means Committee, citing the statistics unearthed by The Washington Post. “The backlog of tax returns is but one symptom of the fundamental issue that has been ailing the IRS for too long: inadequate resources.” The IRS’s productivity plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic as thousands of employees worked from home for months without access to returns, audits and other business — difficulties that followed years of budget cuts. The federal stimulus measures also added to the agency’s workload, as it emphasized getting relief money to millions of Americans. Paper returns took the greatest hit, as mail piled up on trucks outside closed offices for months. Adding to the challenges, a new report from the IRS inspector general this month found that the agency continues to suffer from severe hiring shortages, inefficient practices and old equipment. That includes mail processing woes, since its systems have “outdated dust collectors” that cause paper jams. Poor scanners, meanwhile, meant the IRS last year missed out on $56 million because of “untimely check deposits,” since the agency could not tell whether envelopes it received contained checks. As of Jan. 28, the tally of outstanding individual and business returns requiring what the IRS calls “manual processing” — an operation where an employee must take at least one action rather than relying on an automated system to move the case — came to 23.7 million, the taxpayer advocate data shows. The number includes 9.7 million paper returns awaiting processing; 4.1 million that were suspended because of errors with stimulus payments, pandemic relief or other issues; 4.1 million amended returns; and 5.8 million pieces of correspondence awaiting action between the agency and taxpayers to resolve issues before the returns are completed. In January, National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins had reported a backlog of at least 10 million returns based on IRS data. An IRS official, meantime, said the agency counts the inventory from last year’s filing season at about 6 million paper returns for individual taxpayers. Both numbers are far higher than the unprocessed returns the IRS faced before the pandemic — in the past, the agency typically carried 1 million or fewer returns into the next tax season. But the new data takes into account broader categories of work that have stalled since the pandemic and some returns that have come in this year. Taxpayer advocates, lawmakers and others say the expansive count is more realistic. “This entire ecosystem of pending cases gives the public a fuller picture of what the IRS is up against,” said Chad Hooper, executive director of the nonprofit Professional Managers Association, which represents hundreds of IRS managers. “And it’s a crazy number before most people have filed their taxes for this year.” The stockpile does not include audits lingering because of pandemic slowdowns, enforcement and collection actions, appeals of audits, notices of tax liens, penalties or other business in the pipeline, Hooper said. The vast majority of taxpayers now file their tax returns electronically, and those can generally be processed quickly unless they are flagged for errors, identity theft or other issues. Roughly 10 percent — about 17 million people — still file Form 1040, the traditional individual income tax return, on paper. The IRS is taking at least 10 months to process paper returns filed for the 2020 tax year, and has caught up only to April 2021 for returns without errors, according to the most recent data on its website. Last year the vast majority of taxpayers — about 77 percent — received refunds. Because returns are processed in the order in which they were received, “it does mean the 2022 filings made this year are at the end of the line,” Hooper said. The backlog was formed in part by the mandates placed on the IRS over the course of the roughly two-year pandemic. Beginning in 2020, lawmakers deputized the agency to send direct pandemic relief checks to millions of Americans, adding immense pressure to act swiftly to help cash-strapped families newly out of work. Multiple stimulus packages approved rounds of such payments, and Democrats last March made an even more work-intensive request: to stand up a system that would distribute monthly tax payments to families with young children. President Biden and top Democrats proposed boosting the IRS budget, arguing that the agency had been severely underfunded and understaffed for decades before the added responsibilities. But the effort has so far failed to gain enough support in Congress, while talks continue around a new spending deal to fund the government and prevent a looming shutdown. Democrats and Republicans alike each express confidence they can strike a bargain that funds federal agencies through the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But GOP lawmakers repeatedly have warned Democrats about including “poison pills,” offering a list of nonstarters in October that included proposed increases in funding at the IRS. Rather than support new funding, Republicans this week called on the IRS to “consider exercising its existing authority” to ease the burden on taxpayers. That would include halting automated liens and other collections processes, particularly until the staff can sort through piles of unopened mail, while better prioritizing the kinds of returns in its possession. “When our constituents cannot get help from those tasked to administer our tax laws, it diminishes the integrity of our voluntary tax system,” the senators wrote in their letter. IRS spokeswoman Jodie Reynolds referred questions on the lingering inventory to a letter Rettig sent this week to all 535 members of Congress. Rettig, an appointee of former president Donald Trump, acknowledged an “unprecedented amount of unprocessed tax returns and correspondence remaining in the IRS inventory during 2021.” But he said the problem has been compounded by a lack of funding to hire new staff and modernize its aging computer software systems, some of which date to the 1960s. Rettig said he is considering penalty relief for taxpayers. “We will rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, when appropriate to do so,” he said. “We are doing everything we can with all of the resources available to us.” The agency has already suspended mailing some automated collection notices that are triggered when records show a taxpayer owes taxes and has not filed a tax return. Many of these letters have been sent after returns have been filed but have not been processed. In January, in a meeting with members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rettig said the agency was working to get the backlog of unprocessed tax returns back to normal levels by the end of the year, according to a Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. The commissioner announced last week that he was temporarily reassigning 1,200 employees as part of a “surge team” to help. But Collins told the oversight panel of the House Ways and Means Committee this week that the staffing problems are far broader, compounded by recruiting challenges and low pay. The agency sought to fill 5,000 positions for several campuses across the country in time for this tax season but was able to hire fewer than 200, she said. The situation is so dire that for the first time, officials are offering $500 referral bonuses to employees if a new hire stays in the job for a year. The agency has one of the government’s oldest workforces. Its submission processing unit — responsible for opening the mail — lost 20 percent of its staff last year to retirements, departures and transfers to other IRS departments, officials said. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported this past week that as of August 2021, the IRS faced a total staff shortfall in the submission processing unit of about 2,598 employees. The surge Rettig announced is not going to submission processing, however, but to a department known as accounts management, which is responsible for answering taxpayers’ phone calls and responding to general correspondence. The watchdog said that although the IRS has several initiatives underway to help address its hiring shortages, “to date these approaches have not been successful.” It urged the agency to delay a planned closure of its processing center in Austin — part of a long-term consolidation as more business is done electronically — “until hiring and backlog shortages are addressed.” “Just like many industries across the country, jobs are available, but people are not applying,” Reynolds, the IRS spokeswoman, said in an email. “In [our case,] applicants may not like the shifts or pay — many of these are lower graded positions that were below the $15.00 minimum hourly rate.” The backlog and looming troubles with this filing season led tax preparer groups to form a coalition in recent weeks to pressure the agency for relief. “The service says, ‘Stay patient,’ ” said Nina Tross, executive director of the National Society of Tax Professionals, which has joined with 10 groups to form the Tax Professionals United for Taxpayer Relief Coalition, representing as many as 100,000 preparers. “But there is nobody to help the taxpayer. What is it going to take to get this outstanding inventory through the system?” Tross said that while some automated notices have stopped, many of her clients are still inundated with penalties saying they failed to file or failed to pay, when in fact they have or have sent letters back contesting the charges. Preparers seeking to file power of attorney forms for clients also have gotten nowhere, she said. “They’re sitting on somebody’s desk who cannot come into the office,” she said. “We’re hitting all of these roadblocks, and it’s just not good enough.”",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3uKMVRk,politics
165,2022-02-11,Joe Rogan is too powerful to keep acting as if he’s just a regular guy chopping it up," An earlier version of this story described Charles C. Johnson as a conservative political activist. At the time of his appearance  on ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" Johnson was a conservative activist, but now says he is a supporter of President Biden. The story has been corrected.   Some of us are old enough to remember when Joe Rogan was not a podcaster but rather a genial fire hydrant of a man offering horse rectums and sheep eyeballs to “Fear Factor” contestants in the early 2000s. Some of us might make the case that he is still serving up offal to millions, on his podcast, in the form of chitchat — often entertaining, sometimes repulsive, occasionally hazardous to our health. Rogan, who presides over a large realm of masculine airwaves, has really stepped in it. He was already in the limelight for having guests who spread coronavirus misinformation on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” his incredibly popular podcast. Then, last weekend, clips circulated of Rogan using the n-word in previous episodes. Rogan said he had been trying to discuss the word as a complicated piece of language, not employ it as a slur, but added that he, nonetheless, now found his behavior shameful. Within days, dozens of “JRE” episodes had disappeared from Spotify — at Rogan’s request, according to Spotify’s chief executive, Daniel Ek, who also condemned Rogan’s behavior. Shortly after that, a different platform, called Rumble, offered Rogan a new deal: “How about you bring all your shows to Rumble, both old and new, with no censorship, for 100 million bucks over four years?” Rogan does not plan to accept that offer, as he reportedly told fans Tuesday at a stand-up appearance. So much for any Decision Drama. But the question remains: What does Joe Rogan, media juggernaut and emblem of modern manhood to many, do now? For his most devoted fans, he is a model for how they should think, talk, listen, exercise, eat — and learn, or not learn. So, what’s the lesson? For those of you who aren’t familiar with “The Joe Rogan Experience”: Picture a sweet dude you know deciding, with good intentions but no expertise outside of entertainment and mixed martial arts, that he is going to become a public intellectual. Picture millions of listeners tuning in to listen to this man wrestle, for two or three hours a stretch, with the biggest political, moral and scientific questions of the day. I should confess that I am not one of those devoted listeners. I’ve sat through some full episodes when there’s a particularly interesting guest, and watched portions of other episodes that have been passed around online, but I am not a regular. And yet I can absolutely see why people have enjoyed Rogan. There’s something endearing about a fighter-turned-seeker who now uses his fame to ask Neil deGrasse Tyson curious questions about the universe. The trouble is that many of Rogan’s guests are not Neil deGrasse Tyson. Rogan has hosted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (three times), far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos (twice) and Proud Boys co-founder Gavin McInnes (twice). With more regularity than can be coincidence, his guests utter racist, misogynist and anti-science falsehoods. The bigger trouble is that Rogan seems unprepared to refute these utterances on the fly with any kind of definitive authority. Live-Googling news articles to dispute Alex Jones’s claim that coronavirus vaccines cause widespread illness is all well and good, but it’s no match for Jones’s steady stream of misinformation. Rogan doesn’t need Google; he needs Daniel Dale. Rogan’s mien, as far as I’ve seen, is open and inquisitive, whether his guest is actor Robert Downey Jr. or anti-vaccine advocate Robert Malone. Rogan is neither prepared like a journalist nor learned like an expert. Listeners who defend Rogan by pointing out that he’s not a journalist or an expert — that he’s a merely an everyman whose audience is composed of everymen — are highlighting how much of a risk it is for Rogan to share his enormous platform with guests who are uninformed at best or malevolent at worst. In one clip, resurfaced over the weekend, Rogan’s guest, former conservative political activist Charles C. Johnson, raises the idea that Black people may have a gene that gives them a “proclivity to violence.” Did Rogan immediately end the interview, recognizing that embers of racism could fan into flames in any number of his listeners? No. Did he attempt to debunk the statement by calling scientists, while also acknowledging the history of scientific racism? No. He slowly repeated the name of the gene and then said, “Huh.” Then he allowed Johnson to continue before attempting a rejoinder about how the military is violent while being mostly White, according to a recording of the episode preserved on the Internet Archive. You could argue that Rogan’s generally judgment-free demeanor had allowed Johnson to show his true self. Or you could wonder why Rogan was interviewing Johnson on this topic at all. What did Rogan hope his listeners might learn from this particular dialogue? (When reached on the phone this week and asked to comment about his Rogan appearance, Johnson said that the clip was “from seven years ago” and he regretted ever going on the show. He said he believes “The Rogan Experience” lacks the “rigor” to explore serious topics in proper context, and he now feels it should be canceled.) A frequent rebuttal to Rogan criticism is that he hosts all kinds of guests, liberal and conservative, and that he supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2020 presidential election. But podcast guests are not like carbon tax credits, where a certain amount of pollutive matter can be nullified with a tithing of good sense. Intellectual balance works only when two beliefs are different, but both are reasonable. The opposite of Sanders is someone saying, “I believe health care should remain privatized, and here’s why.” It is not unchecked theories about race and genetics. I don’t think Rogan is doing this in bad faith. I think it’s simpler than that: He’s just not up to the task he has created for himself. He’s not nimble enough or forethinking enough to engage in intellectual battle with guests who are not there to seek truth but to recruit converts. He does not seem fully aware that treating all guests exactly the same doesn’t make you fair-minded, it makes you a patsy. Rogan’s naïve-seeming curiosity makes him likable, but it might come from a place that also makes the trait harmful. He is a heterosexual White dude asking some questions. He can afford to be curious about issues like racism or Islamophobia or misogyny, because he does not have to experience them firsthand. He can believe that the n-word can be treated as an intellectual conversation piece rather than as the single most fraught and painful word in the English language. Being a regular-dude public intellectual could well mean reflecting on all that, and the events of the past week, and what responsibilities Rogan might have to his fans beyond entertaining them. “Don’t let them make you look weak and frightened,” former president Donald Trump advised Rogan in a statement earlier this week, but when it comes to shaping what weakness and strength look like in public life — especially to young men who are curious about the world and how they ought to behave in it — Rogan very likely has more capital than Trump does. Trump’s example is to never apologize and never change. What if Rogan were to go a different way? What if he were to do the work — to acknowledge his past harms, to hire a whole team of fact-checkers to vet guests before they come on and hold them to task once they’re on air. What if he were to allow himself to see that, no, he’s not a journalist, and no, he’s not a regular dude; he’s more powerful than either of those, and that power comes with responsibilities? What if he were to take himself as seriously as he takes the topics he tries to discuss? If this were an episode of “Fear Factor,” this would be the episode where Rogan is dared to overcome the culture wars. The resulting product might not have quite the same appeal as serving up horse rectum, but if he completes the challenge successfully, nobody ends up with a stomachache.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3HMpNFx,"styleperspectivecloseperspective discussion of news topics with a point of view, including narratives by individuals regarding their own experiences"
166,2022-02-11,Maryland lawmakers target Gov. Hogan’s self-destructing messages," Several Maryland Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill meant to curtail the use by Gov. Larry Hogan (R) of messages that self-destruct in 24 hours, or at least bring them further to light. They say it was sparked by recent revelations about the governor’s use of the app Wickr to communicate about a range of public issues with top aides and other state employees. Transparency advocates say it is important that government communications and other records be accessible through freedom of information laws and handled with care, so that archivists, researchers and historians can document the operation of government for future generations. The main provision of the new bill, called the Transparency in Public Records Act, would bring the governor’s office in line with state agencies required to set policies for how long different types of records must be kept. That would not necessarily stop the governor’s office from using Wickr. Most states, including Maryland, have yet to reckon with mobile apps that can destroy government communications before any determination of whether they should be public can be made. A Washington Post report in December detailed use by the governor and state employees of a Wickr network called “Larry Hogan” and chat rooms with names such as “Inner Sanctum,” “Executive Team,” “COVID-19” and “Front Office.” Del. Vaughn M. Stewart III (D-Montgomery), who is lead sponsor of the House version of the bill, said his reaction to reading about Hogan’s Wickr use was “horror.” But rather than trying to ban a particular type of communications platform, he decided it made more sense to promote records retention inside the governor’s office in a broader way. “I think if we polled the House of Delegates, we may get 141 different opinions for what folks think of new technologies and what should be in or out,” Stewart said. “But I hope what everybody can agree with is that the governor’s office should be required to work with the state archivist and the Department of General Services to come up with some plan to determine what to retain and what not to retain.” Hogan, who is considering running for president, has declined to be interviewed by The Post about his Wickr use, but he defended it at a January news conference. “It doesn’t take the place of official government communications, but we certainly have the ability to communicate in an informal way in person, on the phone and through messaging chats,” he said. “I think it’s a pretty common practice and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it.” According to guidance on the Maryland State Archives’ website, how long a record should be kept depends more on its content than whether it’s on paper, contained in an email or, say, sent via a Wickr message. “Transitory correspondence,” regardless of format, need not be kept once its usefulness has passed, the guidance says. Among recent self-destructing messages obtained by The Post through a request under the Maryland Public Information Act was one sent by Hogan’s scheduler. It gave the whereabouts of a binder for the next day, conveying the location through a code name used by Hogan’s security team. The guidance suggests such a message could appropriately be deleted once the binder was located. But the content of some of Hogan’s Wickr messages suggests that under the guidance they should be kept longer than 24 hours. “Stop talking about 1,000 f---ing tests!!!!” he admonished staffers in a 2020 Wickr message, obtained by The Post from a former state employee, as the governor tried to keep the uselessness of coronavirus tests he had arranged from South Korea a secret. Messages of that sort might qualify as “administrative correspondence” sent in the course of carrying out agency functions — which the guidance says should be kept for some number of years before destruction. But because it was sent by the governor, it could also qualify as “executive correspondence,” which the guidance says should be turned over to the Archives for permanent retention. Under current Maryland law, each unit of state government must have a records-retention schedule. The governor’s office asserts it is not subject to this law because it is not a “unit of the state government” but rather its head. The new bill proposes to explicitly define “unit of the state government,” as far as record-retention-schedule law is concerned, as including the governor’s office. The governor’s office’s assertion predates Hogan’s administration. In 2010, the administration of then-Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) took that stance while defending against a public-records claim in a Frederick County Circuit Court case that was ultimately dismissed. The attorney general’s office argued that the legislative history of the record-retention-schedule law — passed in its first form in 1984 — “reveals no indication that the General Assembly intended to disrupt the traditional arrangement between the State Archivist and the Governor.” That traditional arrangement, which lawmakers backing the bill now hope to disrupt, dates back to the 1940s. It has left governors deciding which records to save, with no formal policy, and state archivists trying to cajole them into saving more. In a 1960 article in the American Archivist, former Maryland state archivist Morris L. Radoff described his successful attempt in 1946 to get then-Gov. Herbert R. O’Conor (D) to start handing over records before the end of his second term — avoiding a scramble on his last day in office. “We thought, too, that if we sat with him while he sorted his papers it might be possible to persuade Mr. O’Conor not to take away with him the files that he considered personal,” Radoff wrote. “Some ‘carrying off’ of records by a chief executive is always to be expected, but if possible the limits of what is personal should be set at something less than the scandalous depletion of files, which we have all encountered.” Archivists everywhere still grapple with that issue. Last month, the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents and other items from former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence that the agency said should have been turned over to the agency when he left the White House. Edward Papenfuse, who served as Maryland’s archivist from 1975 to 2013, created guidelines for the governor’s office that included a “guiding rule” that was more of a plea: “When in doubt, save.” Another “general rule” was that “all email relating in any way to the operation of government should be saved and transferred to archival storage.” Elaine Bachmann, whom Hogan appointed as state archivist in June, has said a records-retention schedule from the governor’s office is “something we’d like to have.” In response to a public-records request from The Post, Bachmann said she had no communications from the governor’s office arguing it was not required to have one. “There was no written communication between the Governor’s office and the Archives asserting what was already an accepted and expected practice,” she wrote. Stewart said he doubts lawmakers ever intended to exempt the governor’s office from preservation requirements. “Clearly the public has more interest in a record-retention policy for the governor than it does for, say, the Department of Transportation,” Stewart said. “It doesn’t stand to reason that the legislature would have crafted a record-retention policy and exempted the one instrumentality of the state that the public has the most interest in knowing about.” Hogan’s administration has said he will turn over to the State Archives all emails, which are handled on a Google platform, at the end of his term, presumably late this year. The governor’s spokesman, Mike Ricci, told The Post last year that because the governor’s Wickr use is managed by his political apparatus, Hogan has given his staffers no formal guidance on when to use Wickr rather than email. “It gives them a wide-open, free path to not have to retain anything that they’re saying behind the scenes, on a piece of software that’s intentionally meant to mask their communications,” said Sen. Clarence K. Lam (D-Howard), who sponsored the Senate version of the bill. Lam said that while Republican lawmakers may cast the bill as partisan, he does not see it that way. “We need to put an end to this and stop this whether it’s a Democratic or a Republican administration next,” he said. Legislative committee hearings on the bill are scheduled for Tuesday.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/34B54Gv,maryland politics
167,2022-02-11,"New Zealand switches on sprinklers, and ‘Baby Shark,’ to deter ‘Freedom Convoy’-inspired protesters"," The cacophony outside New Zealand’s Parliament building continued on Sunday as officials upped the ante in their attempts to scatter protesters, blasting “Baby Shark,” “Let It Go” and other songs after sprinklers failed to deter the crowds. The efforts did not appear successful, as the people protesting pandemic measures were heard singing along to a cringe-inducing recorder cover of “My Heart Will Go On,” standing their ground amid cries of “freedom!” The anti-protest playlist included James Blunt’s “You’re Beautiful,” to which protesters swayed their arms in the air, as well as “Let It Go” from the Disney movie “Frozen,” and the viral children’s hit “Baby Shark.” Decades-old Barry Manilow songs and the 1990s hit “Macarena” also reportedly made appearances. Individuals gathered outside Parliament in Wellington for a sixth day, inspired by the massive trucker protests paralyzing the Canadian capital. As with the self-described “Freedom Convoy” in Canada, protesters in New Zealand are unhappy about coronavirus-related restrictions, with demonstrations growing to encompass broader grievances against Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s government. Similar protests have also sprung up around the globe, including in France and Australia. Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard was taking song requests on Twitter for tunes to be added to the queue, tweeting out YouTube links to various songs. (The latest on Sunday was a suggestion by political commentator Emma Espiner for Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire.”) It wasn’t clear whether Mallard himself was DJing — he tweeted out a threat of the recorder cover — but according to the New Zealand government, as speaker he has “control of Parliament Buildings and grounds.” Blunt, the singer behind the mid-aughts ballad, took notice, telling New Zealand police to “give me a shout if this doesn’t work.” Some of the demonstrators enduring the noise were cloaked in ponchos, as Cyclone Dovi brought downpours covering much of the weekend. The rain added to the sogginess from the sprinklers being switched on Friday. “No-one who is here is here legally, and if they’re getting wet from below as well as above, they’re likely to be a little bit less comfortable and more likely to go home,” Mallard said in a statement to local media on Friday. “Some people have suggested we add the vaccine in the water, but I don’t think it works that way,” he added. Meanwhile, in New Zealand:The sprinklers were turned on at Parliament all night to get protestors to leave — but protestors responded by digging up trenches on the lawn to redirect the waterDay 4 of anti-mandate protest modelled on Canada’spic.twitter.com/KrFMDdWZyK Images and videos on social media appeared to show individuals digging up trenches to divert the water, while other people placed cones on top of the sprinklers to keep dry or wore waterproof overcoats. New Zealand police said Sunday they were continuing to monitor and contain protest activity on Parliament grounds. Superintendent Corrie Parnell, Wellington district commander, said police were asking the protesters to “work with us to clear the roads, and allow the public freedom of movement for traffic and surrounding businesses while retaining their ability to protest lawfully.” They were “offering to facilitate an alternative location for the vehicles and campervans” that were blocking roads while protesters continue their demonstration, Parnell said in a statement. Police have found it difficult to “open clear and meaningful lines of communication” with protesters, Parnell said earlier, because the group has a “range of different causes and motivations.” Misinformation, particularly on social media, has been identified as an issue, he said, expressing “concern” that children were being encouraged to attend the protest. “It is important to note that Police on Parliament grounds continue to take a measured approach,” Parnell said. While police there had been seen carrying batons, “that was not in line with current approach and staff have now removed this equipment,” he added. Parliament’s Speaker is trying to wash out the protesters from the lawn by turning on the sprinklers pic.twitter.com/CUX7w9vqBJ The relative mildness of using sprinklers to respond to protesters prompted humor on social media, with one local describing it as “the most New Zealand thing you will see today.” “I hear New Zealand has turned the sprinklers on outside the Parliament building to dissuade the antivax protesters there. They’ll be drenched! I just hope no one offers them free rainsuits,” joked a Twitter user. “So passive aggressive. Love it,” tweeted one person in New Zealand, while another wrote, “Overseas countries have water cannons, New Zealand has sprinklers.” The sprinklers came on around 5 p.m. local time, according to the New Zealand Herald, and were set to “soak” rather than “spray” mode, drenching passersby in an otherwise relatively jubilant atmosphere. Some 53 people have died so far from the coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand, according to Johns Hopkins University data. This month, Ardern said the island nation would begin to ease its pandemic border restrictions, first allowing in New Zealand citizens, residents and some visa holders who are fully vaccinated into the country while maintaining some requirements. In gradual steps, the country aims to lift all of its pandemic travel restrictions by October. Ardern credited strict border restrictions for helping the country avoid large-scale deaths. But now, with the great majority of New Zealand’s 5 million people fully vaccinated, the prime minister said it was time to open up. Rachel Pannett in Sydney contributed to this report.

168,2022-02-11,"Once again, Fox News stokes a protest against a Democratic president"," The story of the protests that have upended the Canadian capital of Ottawa is not yet fully written. That’s true in part because the protest — or, as authorities have called it, the occupation — is ongoing; it’s not yet clear how it ends. It’s also true because all of the details of its genesis have likely not yet emerged. How did it come about? Who was involved in planning and amplifying the idea? Such details often take months to come to light. If, as seems likely, a similar truck-centered protest unfolds in the United States, that last question will have some obvious immediate answers. The American right has been very active in supporting the events in Ottawa and, often, in calling for something similar here. And when we talk about elements of the American right with a disproportionate ability to be heard, we’re talking about the hosts of Fox News’s prime-time programming. In the past month, Fox News has mentioned the truckers or Ottawa 2½ times as often as CNN and five times as often as MSNBC. Analysis by Matthew Gertz of the watchdog group Media Matters estimates that the network has spent more than 10 hours covering the story since the middle of January. The shows on which it has been mentioned the most, according to analysis of closed-captioning data? Those hosted by Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. “It’s hard to overstate the historical significance of what we’re watching right here,” Carlson said on his program Thursday night. “The Canadian trucker convoy is the single most successful human rights protest in a generation.” At another point, Carlson reported that American truckers were planning their own convoy. The graphic over his shoulder read, “Here It Comes.” Tucker: A group of American truckers  announced they will begin a nationwide truck convoy in protest against Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates pic.twitter.com/X1ayXTtqri This was only part of the network’s obvious celebration of what’s underway in Canada. You’ll notice that this is ostensibly predicated, in Carlson’s telling, on President Biden’s vaccine mandates. However, there is no private-sector mandate that would apply to most truck drivers. There is one that applies if they drive across the border from Canada, but there’s a much smaller percentage of American truckers crossing that border than Canadian drivers. In reality, it’s about more than that, of course. A memo sent to law enforcement by the Department of Homeland Security recently noted that it had “received reports of truck drivers potentially planning to block roads in major metropolitan cities in the United States in protest of, among other things, vaccine mandates.” “Among other things” of course carries a lot of weight: it’s shorthand for all of the other things besides mandates that don’t apply to many truckers. It’s an indication that what’s being imported isn’t the movement but the tactic. The movement in Canada was specifically predicated on the mandate. The movement in the Lower 48 would likely be predicated largely on the protest. This is not Fox News’s first such rodeo. The network played an active and even more direct role in amplifying the tea party protests that emerged in the first year of Barack Obama’s presidency — and that quickly overwhelmed much of the national political conversation. If you remember those protests, it’s likely you also remember that the first moment in which they were accelerated by cable-news fury was when, in February 2009, CNBC reporter Rick Santelli railed against a program aiding those having difficulty paying their mortgages. Santelli called for tea-party-like protests against Obama and the president’s purported socialism. That idea gained traction and Fox News quickly amplified it:  As April 15 approached, the tax deadline day on which many of the protests were focused, the network promoted its hosts’ appearances at rallies around the country under the tagline, “FNC TAX DAY TEA PARTIES.” In total, Media Matters counted 73 promotions of the rallies either during programs or during ad breaks. And that doesn’t include the general advocacy for the underlying sentiment. One on-screen graphic from a week before the event celebrated the “growing revolution” that the movement represented. In short order, the tea party movement grew past the boundaries of its ostensibly tax-focused advocacy. It became a significant right-wing force in the Republican Party, pushing the party to the right as the 2010 midterms approached. For a while, the party was able to maintain a tenuous hold over that energy, until Donald Trump arrived in 2015 and blew the whole thing up. For Fox News hosts like Carlson and Hannity — whose face you likely spotted at the Atlanta “FNC TAX DAY TEA PARTY,” above — the utility of a protest is as obvious now as it was then. There’s an enormous amount of energy expressed in opposition to Biden, more so now than there was for Obama in early 2009. For a network whose own stars admit that they hope to see the political left fail, encouraging a protest aimed at potentially shutting down Washington or other big cities helps them to organize and retain viewers already predisposed toward disliking the administration. And, of course, there’s a relatively recent precedent for that activism to lead to long-term political organizing that benefits the right. Such protests may not arise. What’s underway in Canada may wind down; that’s certainty the goal of Canadian authorities. But if there are caravans of trucks that organize in the United States during the next few weeks, we can once again attribute some of that to the network that can’t stop talking about it.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3LlROWG,"politicsanalysiscloseanalysis interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events"
169,2022-02-11,"Pentagon sends another 3,000 U.S. troops to Poland amid threat of Russian attack on Ukraine"," The Biden administration will deploy 3,000 additional soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division to bolster NATO defenses in Poland, U.S. officials said Friday, amid mounting concerns that Russian military forces could invade nearby Ukraine any day. This new wave of soldiers will join other personnel from the 82nd who were dispatched to Poland last week from their home base at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive troop movements. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment Friday, and the soldiers are expected to move out over the next couple of days, a senior defense official said. The deployment was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. soldiers, mostly infantrymen, will bulk up a force that had numbered around 1,700. President Biden has ruled out any possibility that American troops will fight in Ukraine. An additional 300 soldiers from the Army’s XVIII Airborne Corps have set up a headquarters element — Combined Joint Task Force Dragon — in Germany. The operation is being led by  Lt. Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla. Combined, the 5,000 personnel constitute a “highly mobile and flexible force, capable of multiple missions,” the senior defense official said. “They are being deployed to reassure our NATO allies, deter any potential aggression against NATO’s eastern flank, train with host-nation forces, and contribute to a wide range of contingencies.” The U.S. military footprint in Romania, which also shares a border with Ukraine, is expected to grow to approximately 2,000. In all, approximately 80,000 American service members are in Europe on either rotational or permanent assignments, Pentagon officials have said. The new deployments coincide with rising fears of a war in Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday that there is a “distinct possibility” Russia will invade in a “very swift time frame.” He urged American citizens there to “leave immediately.” “There will be no opportunity to leave and no prospect of a U.S. military evacuation in the event of a rush invasion,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House. Missile strikes or aerial bombing could come before an invasion, he said, so “no one would be able to count on rail or air or road departures.” At the Pentagon, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke by phone Friday with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, and held additional conversations with U.S. allies at NATO and in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom, the Pentagon said. Austin, in calls with his own counterparts, laid out steps the United States is taking to reassure NATO allies, said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. The defense secretary spoke with counterparts from Poland, Germany, Canada, France, Romania and Italy. “The Secretary made clear that the United States continues to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border,” Kirby said in a statement. “He also reiterated that we are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time.” Kirby said this week that the 82nd Airborne Division is capable of a number of contingencies, and did not rule out that it could provide “some degree with evacuation assistance” across the border in Poland. “That is clearly going to be — is — one of the missions that they’re capable of doing, trained to do, and will be ready to do if needed,” Kirby said. Kirby also warned that Americans should leave Ukraine. “There should be no need for the 82nd Airborne to have to assist with evacuation and assist in evacuation missions,” he said, noting that there is still time to “do the right thing” and go. Several hundred U.S. National Guard troops remained in Ukraine as of Friday on a mission to train Ukrainian forces, defense officials said. Kirby has said previously they could be withdrawn quickly if necessary.",Washington Post,https://wapo.st/3Jk2VxB,military
